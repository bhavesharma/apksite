You have to tap them many times/refresh phone 4 them to take desired action. When app finally returns;sometimes it's where you left off on their list, most of times you have to re-scroll & occasionally it will take to a whole new list. Many times prices listed is not what is charged. Amount difference is minimal but still incorrect. Nice feature of able to check delivery charges before checking out. It has to many sex toys & pot paraphernalia.","Decent app... but there should be an option to not store credit card info without having to manually delete it every time. And also to remove stored info/searches/things other people viewed that you don't want showing up as items of interest. Some photos are misleading or of two different products, but the reviews and item specifications often clarify things. Would give 3.5 stars if an option.","My previous review stands until the logout issue is corrected. When I logout & someone is able to open the app & place an order without logging back in, that is not account security nor is it Wish taking my account security seriously. Wish is great, but the app sucks. It won't let you logout so it continuosly uses data. It says you're logged out, but you aren't. That's dangerous with my account information stored in your app. I will not be using the app any longer & will only use the website","Great prices, be careful, I may have gotten a bit carried away at first but have regained some self control and have slowed down purchases. Over 40 items in a weekend totaling about $300. All of which aren't needed really. But I still like this app alot.!!!!!!!","Just be careful. Details of the phones and tablets pc in this Apps was confusing or inaccurate. For example; one tablet pc, the dealer writes very good impression on its main picture. But when you read carefully on the product descriptions, you found it contradicting. I can assume that the 'product descriptions' columns is not more than a 'copy paste' details from other items/product. May be those items are from a lazy dealer or scammer.

I get really slow loading times; If you also get that, go into system settings, apps, find this app, then storage, and press 'clear cache'. It stores way too much, and having to do this every month or so is annoying. It doesn't look like it'll get fixed. The actual service of Amazon is great, incredibly convenient and consumer-friendly in loads of ways. I would recommend it to buy things","Its a great place to shop but I wish organizing your shopping cart into different lists was a lot easier. I cannot stress how boring and stressful it is to- especially if you have a lot of items in your cart- scroll all the way down and then click on each item one by one. One misclick and you could be sent all the way back to the top of your cart.","It was good, you would go in shop around now its just all about prime video and music. When paying its unsafe in my opinion I went to settings to ask for permission before purchase, that doesn't work you can just go in and buy something without ever entering a password or anything.","You took away the \"hold and drag to a list\" feature. That is my favorite feature while shopping. You need to bring it back. Its now very frustrating and time consuming when you have to add items to a list now. Smh...who ever had the idea to change this was not thinking clearly...","This App is terrible! It constantly hangs up for several seconds when trying to add filters or look at product images regardless of connection speed or device. I expect more from a company whose annual revenue is in the billions. The app should flow like water when navigating through its many menus and options with little to no lag or delay.

You're back to asking the associates, 😑, who don't usually know where everything is.and give you bogus directions, bless them tho. Update and put this feature back in the app, I'll re-rate again","The app has potential but there's a lot of work to do. The app is well built with good and responsive UI, but it crashes from time to time. The inventory and logistics are terrible. There's pick up from store option but many stores don't know what they have or not have. If you order shipping online, 10 items can come in in 10 different shipments. And remember to filter out 3rd party vendors, there's no quality control and prices are all over the place.","Still needs some attention. Things need to be fixed. No option for deleting all or multiple items from saved list at one time. App runs very slow and shuts down. We should also be able to order as many items as we wish. Someone needs to double check before sending items. I placed an order in the past and received wrong item 3 times. App continously freezes up and cannot get the saved items to even open let alone remove!! ☹☹ All items purchased in store should be available for curbside pickup.","I loved this app, until recently when they decided to mess with it. Now it doesn't work and can't even scan for prices. It always reads \"not in stock\" when I'm standing right in front of the item at the store and they indeed ARE in stock. Also a nuisance that now it asks you to select if you're shopping online or at your store, when it used to detect what store location I was at every time.","Shopping is wonderful, however since updating to this new app it will not allow me to check on as requested. Today is Saturday May 2, 2020 and yet again the app will not allow me to check in. Phone # needs updating, so needed to flag down someone again. However, I still like the intended process. Today is now May 5th and I get an email that my order is ready but your new app STILl Will NOT let me check in.

It does not allow for easy adding of new packages, and packages can no longer be added just as an order number. The packages that have tracking numbers sometimes do not have a map to clearly see where it is, or the map can only be seen through a weird way, and it is not easily seen on the package's page.","I like that I can see all my future deliveries in one place. However, this app needs a lot of work. I have two main problems with this app... First off, I get delivery notifications hours AFTER a package has actually been delivered. Second, it'll randomly list items that had already been delivered months ago as \"in transit\". Uninstalling.","This app was fantastic when it was arrive. Since the \"update\" it's just become basically useless. I wanted this app to track my packages and archive orders that were delivered but now it's grouped all my orders into one including ones that are already delivered and ones still in transit. I cant even separate orders that I placed yesterday from orders I placed months ago...... pretty frustrating. Also not being able to move around the map or zoom in and out (as it was before). Annoying.","So updating my review since the app name and functionality changed. Arrive was good. Shop is bad. You took out so much of the good functionality of the app. Not being able to see the names I called the package on the main screen...bad. No swipe to archive...bad. Having to go three screens deep to see something I used to be able to do in one...bad. Not sure who approved this to go out but you took a good app and made it so bad that if it doesn't change, I'm considering uninstalling it.","When this app was Arrive it was FANTASTIC but now that they switched over to the new ‘Shop’ it’s ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. It is no longer intuitive, half the time it doesn’t grab tracking from emails, and rarely names them anymore. I feel embarrassed that I recommended this app to friends now that it’s so terrible. This app was a life saver when I first found it and now it’s a nightmare and makes more work for me instead of making things easier.

I used to use the feature they had before pretty much on a daily basis.","It has a few hiccups, and they happen at random times. Navigating can become a little hard and confusing at times. I like being able to scroll through products and if I click on an item to look at it and then go back, I want the page to be where I left off and it sometimes jumps back all the way to the top of the page and I have to go back through all of those items I had just scrolled through and it's tiring, so I usually just give up and when that happens, I'm not making a purchase.","This app runs extremely slow. Homepage and searches take a long time to load. In some cases they don't load at all. I love Wayfair but shopping on this app is a challenge.","Doe not let you navigate easily. I used it twice. Each time it automatically purchased items i only had in cart to compare. It was then very hard to cancel the purchases.","This is honestly one of the most user friendly apps I've ever used.

I've managed to get my entire summer wardrobe from shorts to tops and sandals for a very small fraction of the retail price of maybe 2 pieces! Love this app and all the sellers are so kind and price things reasonably for us that can't afford to shop, shop, shop to get good deals! Thanks to all the people that I have purchased from and thanks to Mercari for making shopping so easy and fast!","Not many options to buy. Pages load so SLOW. HATE how we cannot filter out certain words. Lots of games are CASE ONLY and I can't do a \"-case\" on the search bar to remove those. Hate having to select For Sale every time so it removes all the Sold items from the search results. No filtering options to ALLOW the possibility of local meets. I get it.. You want to be \"different\". Other apps do both ship AND meet options . You need flexibility to gain more of an audience.","Hands-down the best selling and buying app! Easy to use interface, sales galore, and way more than just clothing. By far the easiest to use buying/selling app. I feel like I'm actually buying from real people, instead of shady companies. I haven't used it to sell yet, but from a buyer's standpoint it's like a huge digital yard sale, I love it!","It's seriously addictive. Normally I download apps for sites like this and end up deleting them by the end of the day. Not Mercari! I've literally bought something every day! Everyone is very nice, most items are reasonably priced, and Mercari themselves are fast to respond. At some point I'm probably going to need the site to crash so I'll stop buying stuff.","I love everything about the app except for its constant crashing. Sometimes I can go a few minutes, maybe even 10, without it crashing. But other times the app crashes so quickly, I barely have time to scroll down before the app shuts down. This app is basically unusable a lot of the time as a result. Please fix this issue! Otherwise, I absolutely love it."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mercariapp.mercari","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.mercariapp.mercari","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mercariapp.mercari&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.mercariapp.mercari/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.mercariapp.mercari/similar"},{"title":"Nike","description":"Your Own Personal Nike Shop\r\n• Shopping – The best Nike products selected just for you, with free shipping on every order.\r\n• Member Profile – Easily track your activity, orders and purchase history, and enjoy receipt-free returns.\r\n\r\nNikePlus Unlocks\r\n• Reserved for You - Shoes we think you'll want, set aside for you on launch day. \r\n• Exclusive Shop – Products designed and created  exclusively for members within the Nike App. Innovations, collaborations and upgraded materials. \r\n• Nike Experts - Available on-demand to NikePlus Members.

Important, that this should create a notification noise or alert every time there is a message. It doesn't even tell me! So I miss out on sales. This app has potential, and reaches to many local shoppers. What about those that don't respond to listings after 6 months? Ratings are good, my favorite thing about selling here.","This app has alot of potential but its not there. For starters i cant tell you when offer up was last updated because the ui looks exactly the same as it has for the past 3 years. Second when you search something you can scroll through ads that are a few years old and its inconvenient to find something you want for a good price to find out its a 2 year old ad. And finally making it extremely confusing on how to delete ads which put the nail in the coffin for me as it has been left in the dust.","Used to love this app, but lately I'm getting frustrated with it to the point where I'm considering closing my account and uninstalling it for good. I've experienced the same issues as countless others are voicing here. The developers need to listen to these kinds of feedback and make some changes or else people will get fed up and go elsewhere.","Not compatible with Android device's (Anymore). If a seller has more then 19 offers, I can not view anymore then that. I've never had this issue before on any android device. OfferUp refused to help. After awhile they just ignored my situation. Come to find out, when on an Apple device I do not have the issue I'm having. I logged onto my with Android device and the problem continued.","This app use to be amazing. Now anytime I post a offer its suddenly missing without explanation. I get all these error messages. If you log out and try to log back in all you get is more error messages.

The only scary part is some people are dirty and false leading and can tell you it works or whatever but until you actually get home and try the product out to find out its not what they said it was or doesnt have what it says or is totally broken which has happened. And you try to contact them they have the option to ignore and blick you and get away with it. That's what has happened to me before. Its not good to be scandleous","Been using this app for a long time. Here recently it's coming up just showing load errors. Not letting me to browse past the first page. I've uninstalled this app and reinstalled it hoping it would fix the issue. It worked for about 15 mins. I then went back into the app and it went right back to the same issues. Hope they fix this issue I really like the function of this app.","For some reason, the app will no longer allows your search results to work. (Error messages, stuck on only a handful of results) I have uninstalled and reloaded to app. Worked for 1 day and same problem came back. I plan to use other apps until this issue is resolved. I genuinely liked this app. I will use it again once the problem is fixed.","I've been using the app for a while now. Its finally starting to show issues. I cant search or load any other pages without a popup at the bottom saying oops an error has occured. I cant even load messages. This had happened at a bad time as I was trying to make a deal with someone. Overall good if this issue is fixed. Edit. They fixed the issue. Thank you guys. Now I have one of my dream dirtbikes! 5 stars","Crashing since recent update. Whenever I try to view the map on an ad or change the distance on my search, the app crashes. Sometimes I get a popup window notification about it crashing, sometimes it just crashes and other times it crashes and restarts.

My RedCard debit card is integrated (after linking to my account) and the 5% discount and free shipping are right there in the card before final checkout, so you know what's going on. Lastly, if you're doing curbside pickup, it's different than regular in-store pick-up, so keep that in mind and finalize order accordingly","Not user friendly, this app needs so much work. It's not convenient to check out. There's so many questions even though my information is saved. I have to go back and get my card out all over again. What's the point of having the information saved if it's going to so ask twice to verify everything. It's just not convenient online shopping. I want to click on my others and check out hassle free like Amazon.","The features are not intuitive to use, especially when you have to scan items for discounts as you shop (when physically in the store), then transfer that info to the cashier. Why do we also have to enter our phone numbers at the register? As for online ordering (for pick-up), it's really irritating to see \"offer available\" next to something placed in the shopping cart, without the ability to actually see what offer I might be missing. Clicking on it doesn't link to any information.","Pretty bad app. 1) Can't choose quantity before adding to the cart. Have to go into the cart and then increase quantity. For each item! 2) No simple add to cart button on the item details page. Have to choose pick up or deliver it instead. No need to make me choose this on every item. I can decide it on the checkout page. 3) No clear error messages shown, only a warning sign shows up without explaining what's wrong. Overall, too much effort on the user to figure the app out.","It's not a easy and doesn't function as well as I would like. When click the \"in stock\" button, it does not show only in sock items, it shows all items still, and when you open the details of the item, it then says \"temporarily out if stock\" or \"available at another store\". Neither of those are helpful I think they need to make it more accurate, especially for the in person or drive up pick up."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.target.ui","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.target.ui","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.target.ui&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.target.ui/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.target.ui/similar"},{"title":"The Home Depot","description":"It’s a good time to be a doer.\r\n\r\nDIY IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND\r\nSave time with The Home Depot app. Shop over one million products and find the info you need most. \r\n\r\nSNAP A PICTURE, FIND WHAT YOU NEED\r\nDon’t know what something’s called?

You may now change the delivery address after placing an order (before it has been shipped). No need to contact customer service!","comments":["LOVE this app. It makes shopping easy and fun (especially the flash sales.) They now have Afterpay on the app, instead of having to log in on the website to access it. They provide a USPS tracking number for ALL of your orders, as well as messenger notifications, and don't stop updating the status after it's been shipped (like WISH.) You get points for reviews and shopping (1 point = $0.01), which really helps once you stack them up for a large haul. Have not and any issues with this app. 10/10!","I very much enjoy this app. It's great for cheap fashion. Shopping and ordering are super easy, there's so much to offer that I find myself just scrolling as if it were a social media page. They offer coupons all the time and a point system when you order and review. As for returns, I'm sure it's easy but I've been had to return anything. Happy shopping!","I love this app! I wouldn't have though I'd fine clothes I like and would fit but they do! They have such a good range of clothes and styles. I've never been disappointed with what I've bought, one thing I would say it always check to material as some item are made from a material you wouldn't expect it to be and therefore may not fit how you want it to, having said that I always check so I've never been surprised and unhappy with what I've received. Homeware also has a good range 👍👍","I love this app. It's so easy to navigate and when you put something in your basket it automatically shows you similar options. There is so much variety. The quality is usually good, but the best thing is that its cheap enough to buy something you might only wear a couple of times. The only downfall is I spend too much money here with at least one order per month!","The SHEIN shopping experience is mostly 99% positive, some details but nothing important, most of the time you get your merchandise in perfect condition, the clothes are of good quality and super cute at times beautiful and other wonderful I really love it!

It was convenient and I didn't have to wait in line to checkout. I scanned the barcode of each product I placed in my cart. It provided a running total and I was able to checkout using the app. The people greeter at the exit scanned the QR code from my phone and verified an item and I exited the store. Also if this is too simply say...\"I really enjoyed using this function of the app\".","Love, love the Sam's Club app! Scan as I go, no waiting in line; when it is time to check out I show my phone and cart to the Exit ckerk and they scan the barcode from the app and away I go. Thanks alot Sam's Club. Still loving this app! Saves so much time and keeps us contact free in this crazy way of Covid-19. Only had one time that the app didn't work and I had to go through the line. Guess the system was just overwhelmed when Covid-19 first started. Other than that the app has worked fine.","I am having the same problem with the app as I am with the website! It claims items are in stock online & lets you add them to your cart. I added 2 items to my cart, I went to check out & it tells me that 1 of the items are out of stock so, I proceed to check out with the other. I selected the card & checked out, then a window pops up telling me that I can't check out because the item is not in stock. This is ridiculous! I'm paying to shop at your store & you dont have a decent prgm set up!!","Scan option no longer works on galaxy s9 plus. I have updated, reinstalled, factory reset my phone the whole lot. It is incredibly frustrating. The app is useless to me without the scan option. I keep looking for a working update but have yet to find one. This has been an issue all year. I'm reconsidering my business membership all together.

When it works, it's a great way to make some money (when bots aren't stealing the orders). But it RARELY works. For example, I'm in SF and visited Oakland a few days ago. Ever since, I'm only shown batches/orders in Oakland when my GPS should clearly tell them I'm no longer in Oakland, I'm in SF. There's too much miscommunication between Google Maps and this app. And tech support has never helped.","I don't know if it's the high volume of people now using the app but it rarely works properly, always connection issues I'm constantly refreshing and foreclosing the app. I used to get batch after batch, it was great! Now there's very little batches, batches 40 mins away or the batches come in faster than you can possibly grab them. Please fix these issues!!! I understand the system got hacked but still Instacart used to be great, now it's just a headache!","No support available when there is an issue. There are bugs with the app on a daily basis, but today they added a COVID questionnaire that has messed up the works. The COVID questionnaire is popping up when I try to view batches. I answer no and then click submit then an INCOMPLETE verify screen pops up. It doesn't show the complete paragraph and there is no button to verify my answers. There is no way to verify, and without verifying it won't let me get batches. I am stuck page with no help.","When it does work, it works... which is seldom as you use it throughout the day. Always crashes, freezes, or lags the farther you go into the store from the entrance. So technically, it is working at its own glacier pace. Help directory doesn't answer anyting and directs you to shoppers support. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN ANY COMPANY GUARANTEED. If issue is of any urgency or requires work on their part, plan to waste 45mins to 3 hrs.. just so they understand issue..if they don't disconnect first","App is a little glitchy at times... Sometimes I need to take multiple pictures of my drop offs n even then I'm not sure they go through? Also, there's no driver support except through email. Their phone number has been deactivated.

You guys need to sort out your app. It does not work right with your login servers or something. If the app doesn't kick some kind of false error when logging in, it freaks out and forgets about the login info when trying to check out with a purchase. honestly do better to have the app act as a shortcut to your actual website rather than having a standalone app. I'm u installing and just using the browser for the foreseeable future. Supremely frustrating.","The backend developer team at Lowes sucks. Their regex checking sucks... I cannot believe that they limit my password size to 12 characters.

It also kept erroring out saying my password was incorrect even when it was correct such that I had to reset my password each time, yet I couldn't use the same password as before.

The app gets in a loop when I try to checkout and keeps asking me to log in and then sends me back to my cart where I again select checkout and it asks me to log in again... Repeat.

I only dock a star because I wish there was a better search, such as needing a way to exclude products with certain words. For instance: \"MTB wheelset -disc\" should return mountain bike wheel listings that don't mention disc brakes, but there is no way to do this on the app. Most modern search engines have more advanced features.","Unfortunately it's not possible to rate below one star ! This app is garbage, so complicated to use. I have been trying to add my bank card for weeks and it's still not working. My email was verified but any time I try to buy something aliexpress blocks the payment! Even when I tried to go through the security questions I couldn't submit?! Wait what !??? It seems to me that this app doesn't want my money. This is ridiculous. The easiest part in all apps is payment f*** option, here it's not. Bs","It displays a wide range of goods and products for your needs and offers good discounts during the sales season for most items. Communication responses with sellers are quick and fast for enquiries and clarifications Purchased items received without any problems so far. Reliable support team is very prompt in advising delivery status via email messages. The tracking system in the app is very useful re delivery status of the package.","The overall app experience seems good but sometimes when we are seeing any product and then click on back button and then again open that product it takes lot of time to load the proper page and the page does not get loaded despite of app restarting, and when we close the app from task manager and again open it then it works fine. This is the bug i am experiencing from the past few weeks. Hope the team will get it fixed soon.","I really like the fact that almost everything can be found and purchased here, but to those in Africa a lot of people want to buy but do not have the credit cards, so i think if you can integrate your payment system to include mobile money payments, it will not only make the end user comfortable but it will also make you maximise your sales."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.alibaba.aliexpresshd","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.alibaba.aliexpresshd","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alibaba.aliexpresshd&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.alibaba.aliexpresshd/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.alibaba.aliexpresshd/similar"},{"title":"Chewy - Where Pet Lovers Shop","description":"Chewy just made shopping for your pet easier.

Like on Inbox Dollars when u go to a store u can hit your scanner on your phone and they have specific things that u have to find and scan , for points, at the store, it's fun. And fetch should do that.","I love this app, simply scan your receipt from any grocery/gas station at any point within 2 weeks of purchase and you get points regardless of what you buy. Dont have an ads problem with it yet and it has not crashed at all in my first 3 weeks of using it. *(Only problem is that i wish there were more choices to earn big points other than the 1-n-done.) Because of this i think it deserves my 5 stars! Keep up the good work.","Great idea, and I thought it was fine at first. But now it constantly freezes, does not record full receipts. I finally just gave up. Will uninstall. Two months ago, I uninstalled this app. Got an email yesterday reminding me I had 2500 points to spend. Figured I'd give it another shot. Figured maybe with so many complaints about camera freezing up, maybe they took heed and fixed it. Nope! Just tried scanning a receipt. Kept freezing up. Uninstalling again, staying uninstalled.","app runs slowly 5/2/20 Update Still runs slowly. For what should take a few minutes to upload receipts, took 10+ minutes today. The camera paused or locked up 80% of the time, after going to another app and coming back, it paused on the splash screen. I had to do a force stop to recover. It burned 10% of my power in 10 minutes. Logout takes 4 taps plus a scroll. All of this time is not worth the minimal benefit for me. I will be uninstalling after reaching the next reward level."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.fetchrewards.fetchrewards.hop","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.fetchrewards.fetchrewards.hop","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fetchrewards.fetchrewards.hop&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.fetchrewards.fetchrewards.hop/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.fetchrewards.fetchrewards.hop/similar"},{"title":"Etsy: Buy Custom, Handmade, and Unique Goods","description":"Shop millions of one-of-a-kind items and find the perfect thing for you.

Some customers need their item sent to a different address or the address is incomplete/wrong, however entering a new address is close to impossible. Not a problem if sending via FedEx. Also, it does not let you scroll down to delete more than 1 label. Please fix this!! It's very annoying.","When I need ANYTHING, I always shop ETSY first...& last (because their search system is easy & efficient!)! I not only find what I'm looking for, I end up with lots of choices & usually some new ideas! For over 15 years & I've always loved what I purchased...whether for a gift, my home, or myself! I'm disabled and bedridden...I don't \"shop\" anywhere else online! (Even before I became bedridden!) These shop owners make what they sell & give a very personal touch! I LOVE ETSY & YOU WILL TOO!😊","This is a site wide issue. I've tried to purchase things through the app and the website but when it comes to adding my card it says that the information is wrong or incomplete when its not. I know I'm not the only on that has had this issue so please resolve it... I'd like to be able support individuals and artist especially during these times.","Careful! This app doesn't do everything that you need to be able to do for your Etsy account. Its ealry 2000s vibes insists making key changes (postal address, cc nbs) on a \"desktop\" version, without telling you that that's the only way to do it. Very unfortunate. Made me lose two items. Thank God I love the sellers. Coz I certainly don't love the app.","The app was working perfectly fine before these recent updates and changes now shops are more difficult to search through thanks to everything being seperated and now i can no longer search shop lists or created lists it just shows my own every time instead.

Half of the things I normally buy are in-store purchase only, for reasons nobody can really explain to me. God forbid I have preference for a brand-name item that I KNOW I can find in the store near my house - this app wants none of that. Walmart uses this app to push their in-store brands, and doesn't provide a complete selection, forcing you to go inside the location to get them. And if I have to go in the store anyway, there's really no point in using the app to begin with.","Works ok but is not clear that you've checked in. No button or anything to acknowledge my choices, not confirmation from the page I'm on. It does recognize you've arrived, but clicking that multiple times removes the selections I previously made, adding to the confusion. I did eventually see a notification that I had checked in successfully, but then I could not get it to go away until I restarted my phone.","I love this app because I've always avoided the stores even before the quarantine. So the people with the negative feedback as of late must not be considering the overhaul, I.e. crashes. And yes you HAVE to check out once you've reserved a time, it tells you that; there ARE other people waiting to do the same. My advice is to do pick up couples days in advance, that way you can reserve, add items over time and then check out the day before. Thank you Walmart! You have always made my life easier!","So frustrating! Trying to checkout but it keeps going in circles once I pick my payment method and checkout it goes right back to picking th payment method again. This is not the first time it has don't this. I have done everything short of uninstalling to fix this problem... Please fix it","This used to be a wonderful app. For the last 3 weeks app is crashing, cant add items, can't schedule a pick up, if I am lucky enough to get a time slot it will not let me cash out then I lose my time slot bc I only have an hour to check out and it will not let me! Orders that i have been able to pick up, the pickup process is a joke. App crashes when you get to the store, associated do not know when you are there. Have never been able to check into parking spot #.

It was the first inexpensive shopping experience I've had with an app. The new format is not great. I think they need more categories. They really should include the shipping in the price. And I am sick of getting notifications every 20 minutes about a product I was interested in. I'm sure there is a setting I can change, but I'm deleting the app which is much easier.","Common sense is the name of the game here. Obviously look at the description of the item, check the shipping (most of the items are free shipping but some items do the whole \"$1 item with $30 shipping\"), make sure you check other sources to find the best price, note that shipping is a 1-2 month span. That's all I can think of. Like other people say, it's mostly Wish trinkets like dog tags and rings. They have a phone or two that gets bid up the ass but that's it. Recap: Research = Save time/muns","Love this app!! I am disabled...I can spend several hours a day going thru the items available to bid on. At least it gives me something to do for awhile and I can bid on and win some pretty awesome things LOL!! Plus, most things ship free. This app is a win win!!","This app is appaling. Ive used it for a while, if the item dosnt arrive you have to wait 60 days before they can refund you. Credit dissapears from the account itself, mines dissapeared so many times and if a items not arrived correctly then if you want to refund, they will send you the credit to post back in tophatter credit which you cant even use. So you have to pay the postage back to. Please save your self ... i wish they would fix these issues and stop taking money from tophatter credit","It is fun to find things that you wouldn't normally have thought of or would have found anywhere else.

Happy bidding!","comments":["I have played on Deal Dash for over 10 years and have experienced many good and bad matters. First the good... I have won many items and enjoyed playing because playing helped me relax and manage my PTSD. It gave me the opportunity to share many items with family, friends and others in need, especially those serving in the military. I have stayed true to the policy of not selling the things I have won and have NEVER accepted a penny for anything I have won. I must also commend the customer support department, it is one of the best I have every experienced with any company. Th the credit of Deal Dash they offer a wide variety of items for the players to choose from. Now the bad... Being a player for such a long time, I've been able to see the site evolve and unfortunately one major problem are players that prevent others from winning more of the better prizes and bully those who dare to challenge them while playing. It's a matter the company should vest more time to resolve or at least set up game changes to prevent the poor actions of a few discourage others from playing. I'm willing to assist if asked for positive input. Another sour note is team playing and while it isn't as obvious to many players, being a long timer I know those that do so. And like most things in life you got good and bad. In spite of these issues I still will rate the company with 5 stars because as said earlier it's helped me help many others and has been worth every penny spent.","It's not free.. first off you gotta buy bids.. then you gotta bid like 30 or 40 bids on ONE item.. IFF you're lucky to win something... you pre-bid on something and so is EVERYONE else.. chances are, someone else wins and if you do win, let it be known its going to be so much more than you're hoping to pay!! All I have to say.. you're buying more bids than what you win.. If there's a ton of people that want the same item, there's no point because theres always someone who prebid more than u","Needs more variety of products, and be able to buy as many bids as we like, for instance,,, if we want 2 bids, a 300 bid package, or 72 bids,, we should be able to buy as many as we like...(and from one business owner to another,, the lower amount of bids someone buys, the higher price they are).. example: 299 bids and below are 29 cents, 300 is 13 cents each, 301 to 499 are 24 cents each, 500 is 12 cents each, etc etc.... thank you dealdash!!!!","DO NOT INSTALL!! This takes your money without giving anything. It is probably the worst app out there. There are \"bots\" that bet so you never win and only waste your money. I wish I never fell into this trap.

If it worked, it would be great, but as it is, I really DISLIKE it.","Sometimes it works for checking and submitting my prescription refills and sometimes not, I have a lot of problems with it, and it has nothing to do with my phone. I have a new phone, I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and still have the same issues with it, all my other apps on my phone work perfectly, not this one, I have called their customer service of course they couldn't do anything, very frustrated with this. UPDATE-I CALLED YOUR PHONE # THEY WERE NO HELP!!!","Awful update, can't use it anymore. I log in, check - yes, I have a preferred store set in my profile, go, choose a bunch of photos, wait wait wait for them to load... Then the app wants to use my location to find a store for me, only, it won't. It is stuck there. I have photos to print, got a recommendation?","This app has problems and so does Walgreens! 6 months ago I received a new prescription for Xanax. The app asked ME if I wanted to put it on auto refill so I chose to use it. For 6 months it filled it automatically. Every month it filled it early. At the end of 6 months I had 10 extra pills. Then it locked me out when I called the pharmacy they were No help. I didn't need anything I just wanted to see if the new prescription was still on auto fill. They told me This drug can't be on auto fill?","This app keeps logging you off and then you can't log back in. The verification process doesn't work and you have to uninstall and reinstall the app. Despite this problem being reported multiple times, Walgreens won't fix it. All they do is reply with pat answers (\"Oh no. We are so sorry...).

One can't place an order for pick up with the app, nor can we add items to our shopping list while browsing. Actually the app's shopping list seems to be completely different from the website one I have on my computer. If it says an item is $5 off I can't tell if that's a coupon I need to save for later, an automatic saving in the store for which I don't need the app, or am I supposed to just show the ad during checkout?","We happen to have both Sam's and Costco right now. Compared to its competitor Sam's Club: 1. Doesn't support scan and go. This has been a big relief at Sam's. No queues baby. 2. Can' find in the app the items available in the club. We bought naan several times at the C but this can't be found in the app. While I thought S doesn't carry it I found it in the app. Guess I need to look at the shelf more closely next time.","When it works, it's relatively useful. More often than not, app requires a sign in to display the member card, but never accept the sign in. I have to delete & reinstall it in order to get the member card to display. I'm on my 5th reinstall to work around this annoying glitch. I think carrying a physical card might be a tad bit easier. Costco should be embarrassed to have this released with this problem.","App has lots of bugs that haven't been fixed with any updates. Will sign you out every time you go out of app, even if still running in background. So you have to sign back in every time which will leave you on a different page than what you were on. Also unable to buy or renew memberships on app or website. Keeps giving error. Called customer service and still hasn't been fixed. I'm trying to give you money and you won't let me","The only good part of the app is the digital membership card. To the people not able to login: make sure you change region to your country. It defaults to US and will not allow you to login. The app is kinda stupid for doing this and not making it clear. I had to turn on location and then set a home Wearhouse, then it offered me the region change."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.costco.app.android","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.costco.app.android","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.costco.app.android&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.costco.app.android/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.costco.app.android/similar"},{"title":"Poshmark - Buy & Sell Fashion","description":"Poshmark is the leading marketplace to buy and sell fashion.\r\n\r\n***Shop over 5,000 brands in every size—including plus size, petites and juniors— at up to 70% off retail\r\n***Sell and turn your closet into cash.

It's stupid to go through the trouble of creating a whole new listing to provide extra photos. Now I'm adding the fact that I have to wait 3 hours to press ship on an item to protect the buyer from an \"accidental purchase\" 3 hours to be able to ship an item?!! That's insane!! Why not ask the buyer upon making purchase if it's even an accidental purchase if not they can proceed to buy?!","WOW. I have never been this happy to have my opinion proven wrong! My first experience with this app (which was colored by some neg reviews and comments) wasn't great, but once I made the decision to buckle down and do it right (e.g. get to know the app, take lots of good pics, price things reasonably, etc.) I was really, truly blown away by how GREAT this app is!! I've used a half dozen other sites, but I sold more on Poshmark in the first 24 hours than I've sold over the past MONTH! Luv it!","Love this app and site!! I've been looking for some very specific items, and found them right away on Posh! Also like that they have items other than clothing and shoes. My Go-To site for first check of something I'm looking for (sometimes even before Amazon!! 🙊).","I really like poshmark! It took me a while to figure out how the bundles and shipping worked, but I have already gotten a couple of great deals! This is way better than Kijiji, Letgo and a lot of the other selling sites!","I love this app! Great deals on designer, vintage or handmade items & clothing. Use the code GROOVYGLAM to get $10.00 credit when you sign up. Easy to list if you want to sell. You can make good money if you are active. No listing fee to sellers but 20% commission fee once an item sells. The return policy is fair to sellers and buyers.

Upon using it on a different device and getting a similar outcome leading to another device getting contaminated, I had to delete it again. Rumor is that the company is closing, so i'm guessing that's the reason for these lack of dev maintenance.","I've made already several successful purchases through out the year in many amounts in the same website. All of a sudden it's declining as well as saying the address is different than on my card when I never changed anything. Credit is fine and everything for the soft pull. Customer service only copy's and pastes whats already on the site. No emotion, pure laziness. They wanted me to screenshot them the issue even though you can't because of security policy. What a complete Joke.","Check credit score still ok. Lots of purchases paid them back minus one. Not sure if a knew automated system but its faulty and glitch. Based on other people post same problem same response from Klarna we are having problem with automated system . We haven't in the past. What is really going on? All good things come to end time to delete app. I just had to purchase my product . It was good while it lasted. As stated in will not even qualify me for what system say I'm eligible for.

But if I need a mask the app makes sure to show me millions of results.... Oy. I'm going to try to use the site online and see if there's a difference. 🤦🏼‍♀️","The bug is fixed and the app no longer randomly closes. But since then I ran into an issue with a seller not sending out my package that I had bought way before this covid 19 situation and dh gate has done nothing to resolve the issue. I'm finding that they don't really seem to care about the customer. They are seriously one of the worst companies to work with when it comes to getting a refund back.","New Update: It seems the developers finally managed to fix app. Updated review: The developer pushed a \"fix\" that has now made this app useless. It used to crash so much that I didn't think it could get any worse. Apparently the developer took that as a challenge and managed to make it completely useless now. This app crashes within 30 seconds of opening it and continues in a reboot - crash cycle until you close it down. Helen Keller out for a Sunday drive would crash less than this app does.","Basically a shopping mall made up of dozens of different sellers, happy with about 75 to 80 percent of my purchases, but their customer service is somewhat robotic and unhelpful dealing with issues, plus frustratingly unable or unwilling to communicate directly with sellers. Bit of a language barrier. Beware tracking info. It is not always accurate.","They must hire 10 year olds to develop their app. I just wasted 45 minutes of my life trying to figure out how to add a different credit card so I could purchase their item. You would think it would be under the title \"My Credit Cards,\" but nope, you have to delete the card you have, go in and try to purchase the item at which point since there is no card, it will then ask you for credit card information.

Now that's over and half the time even if you have a qualified purchase, the app refuses to recognize the barcode. Waste of time Update: Just got an email threat to start charging an \"account maintenance fee\" if I don't cancel my account or start using it again. Unreal. Stay far away from this company.","Was good but going downhill. For the past 2 days, the app has been crashing on startup (Android). So I can't even use it. The choices in coupons lately have been substandard in my opinion. Also, I wish they're was an option to upload online orders and get credit. With Coronavirus, I've mostly been shopping online. If I was a new user, I'd score the app 1 star but because it performed well for me in the past, I gave it 3 stars.","I have been using this app for several years. I enjoy it. I probably get about $100/ year in rebates; more then any other rebate or points app I've ever used. That being said, it is the biggest pain in the neck. It constantly freezes or won't open and you have to log in from a mobile device. I don't think I've ever received a valid response to an issue from customer service. It's very annoying at times.","It's rare to find coupons for any of the products that I normally purchase. I'm certainly not going to buy products I don't normally buy just because there's a coupon for it. Lately, this app has refused to open. I see the intro screen, and then a black screen. I keep closing all apps, reopening it, and seeing the black screen. This app is becoming increasingly frustrating and not worth my time.","It's great, but sometimes will not work when you want to pay for your items for example at Walmart. When I was out of state l tried to pay \"in store\" at many approved sites and the app did not work. You lose out on that cash when that happens. Also I wish it would let you scan the receipt from all stores. If my husband goes to Fareway for example, he doesn't want to mess with the app etc, so it would be nice to be able to scan the receipt at home."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.ibotta.android","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.ibotta.android","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ibotta.android&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.ibotta.android/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.ibotta.android/similar"},{"title":"JOANN - Shopping & Crafts","description":"Shop in the app, join our rewards program, shop the weekly ad, get coupons and personalized deals, or browse thousands of projects for inspiration.

Deals are good. Only complaint is the email list frequency for ads when you sign up. I get emails daily sometimes 2x a day. When signing up it automatically sets your email to this OVERKILL amount of advertising. Its ridiculous and unnecessary. I shouldn't have to go into settings just to adjust amount of emails to decent level. Emails everday multiple times a day is uncalled for and boardline harassment.","Really needs improvement. While it tells you items are in stock the reality is they are not to many items get canceled in orders because the app takes to long to update with current stock numbers. There needs to be a way for customers to cancel orders and not have to wait 4 days of not picking up the order. Claiming money in accounts are on hold is a lie, I always get charged for items that are canceled and have to go into a store to get a refund. Processing and filling orders takes way to long.","I have successfully used this app and then recently 5/2, it just keeps shutting down when going to items in cart and checkout. Couldn't order, missed discount! The search engine is a pain and many functions don't work properly in trying to navigate (wish list & others) and not being able to use this app during store closure is most frustrating. Shopping takes forever when you can't see whats at your local store for free pickup. Lots of great fabrics but not available locally or online. SAD!","As much as I love JoAnn, this app is the definition of glitch. It is always down. The checkout buttons and features are usually broken. I have several items in my cart and I can't even press the \"proceed to check\" button. I have 20 items in my shopping cart and it says my subtotal is $0 with a $3 discount being applied. What????!! I also have to search very hard to locate items because basic keywords do not match up. I could go on. Several updates need to be made","Overall works fairly well. When ordering online, however, leaves something to be desired. You can't always tell what's really available and putting items in the cart sometimes takes a long time before you realize the warehouse is out of what you want. Or, when you are looking for a specific thread (like serger cone threads) the \"computer\" doesn't know what you mean. Then you are on a wild goose chase trying to figure out how to communicate your need.

Please let us know by leaving us a review in the Google Play Store!<br><br>In this release:<br>- We have had to update some parts of the app, which means that the app is only supported on devices running Android 4.4 and above.<br>- We&#39;ve fixed some minor visual issues.","comments":["Loved it at first. Super simple and really convenient. I made about 5 orders, all under 20 dollars, through Afterpay and paid them all off on time. Then one day my order was declined. I reached out and got nothing but generic responses. Basically they'll just cut off your spending with no explanation. I don't know what the logic is but it's ridiculous, and customer service is full of excuses and attitude.","I really enjoy the simplicity of this app. I have seen more complex apps that have more issues running all the features. I have yet to run into any problems and the organization of the app is easy to navigate. I do wish that the categories for online retailers were able to be broken down to what you're searching for and hopefully as it grows there will be some way to incorporate items.","I love this app and have been using it for a while - probably too much lol. However, my recent experience was upsetting and I'm ready to uninstall this app. I made an online purchase to a retailer who only offers store credit for online returns - that part I don't mind. I still had 2 payments left and even though I returned the item & no longer have it in my possession at all, I'm still on the hook for those payments. NOWHERE is that expressed on Afterpay's website - very deceiving!!!","Love this convenient way to pay. Uses your credit card to spread the payments over several weeks or months. You don't owe interest if you don't miss the small payment.. Very convenient for small purchases.. I really like this and they let you know days in advance when payments are due...","Afterpay is a fantastic idea! I am so glad it is here, and I am able to use it. I don't have the best of credit, Plus I don't like using credit cards, so this really helps me out. I am a just and blown away that there is no charge for this! There's only a charge if you don't pay your payments on time. And I love that there is no penalty for early pay off. And I love that I get my items right away, I don't have to wait until it's paid off.

This is only one of the issues I have been having, along with the phone itself (discontinued galaxy refine). Spent over a week offline after the last tower update... they kept saying the towers were still down. Finally found a boost store that had a service rep who knew how to 'fix' the J7 issue -- not recognized as a valid phone on the network. He had 'fixed' over 12 other J7 refines that day.","I love being with Boost I've been a loyal customer for years sinces 1999 when I had my first phone. And that was a Nokia phone when I had to buy prepaid cards to activate my phone now it total different. Boost mobile has been everygood to me and the serves has been great for me all these year never complained a it or anything.","Good amount of perks. But I'm still so angry with Boost as a customer service company that I am seeing RED. I LOVE THE phone I bought but I didn't get any deals.

When checking what products are available for a coupon, I'll scroll then get to the point where I can't see more and it's just timing out. Oh and tried multiple times to filter by price and it WOULD NOT do it. Applied it over and over, hoping I'd be able to see products I want. But app has previous issue. Was hoping that if it's going to stop scrolling, at least I won't be seeing the $40 face creams.","Login problem. Tried using finger scanner and inputting password manually, and neither worked. I keep getting a 'Server down' message. ALSO: Google Play Protect window keeps popping up. At first got a message informing me that CVS app was protected. I wasn't sure if that was causing my login issue, so I disabled it. Now every time I relaunch the CVS app, that Play Protect window pops up asking me if I want to enable it. I even deleted/reinstalled the CVS app. Still no change. VERY frustrating.","I only use this app to order refills. That being said, the pharmacy part of this app is the only part I have knowledge about. In the regards it works perfect. I can see when my meds are next due for refill, refill them from the app, and then get notified when they're filled so I can pick them up.","Awkward UI. If the app is telling me my login session is expired, the next thing the app should do is go to the login page. Sometimes I feel like this app is giving me a run around! When I'm looking at the details for a prescription, if I navigate back it should bring me to where I was last, not to the top of the list of prescriptions. Try harder please!","Photo app frustrating, I spent a lot of time choosing the photos I wanted to pick to print. this took forever because the uploaded photos don't actually show you have to click them one by one to decide if it's a photo you want. I added them to the cart and the app crashed losing everything I did. I gave it benefit of the doubt and while I was annoyed decide to try again this time it crashed before even getting to the cart.

SAVE FOR LATER or FAVORITES...I find a lot of things that I want to purchase but cant afford to purchase all at once so I have to just hope I can remember them or find them next time. There has been more times than I can count that I have had tons of stuff in my cart but couldn't afford it all so I had to go in and remove every item out of my cart except for the one I was buying at that moment. Please add that feature","Downloaded it a day or two ago, did some shopping and went to checkout today. When I clicked on my cart to check out, it just shows a blank white page no matter what I do. It shows the number of items but nothing else. Cool...guess I'll uninstall the app and try again. It was great and easy to use until I couldn't check out.","I dislike this app so much! Everytime I attempt to use it whether it's for shopping or paying my Kohl's charge it makes me create an all new password. I can't begin to tell you how annoying that is! I know user error is a real thing, but that isn't the case here because I write the password down on my notepad on my phone and update it each time I have to change it. It really should be much easier and so therefore I hardly use it, until I absolutely have to in order to pay my credit card bill.","Very easy to navigate. The only problem that I have is that when I'm looking @ an item and then I filter, for example, whether it's available for store pickup it will say yes bu then when I add it to my cart the app will prompt to pickup at another location. Otherwise, I enjoy shopping from the app a whole ton more than I do @ my local Kohl's. They have accused me of shoplifting 3 times now!!It even happened after I pointed out how the thieves were able steal the item LP was unable figure out.","Your app needs updated bad. All of the pictures of the clothing is blury on scroll. Have to click on the item, then click on the picture to inhance. .. also i have tried four times to create an account so that i can start making a feiw list, would not let me create one so I will not be shopping through your store app. Another note, your birthday calendar needs to be simplified. Hope I can use the app in the feuture.

I re-downloaded the app like 4 times and still the same thing over and over and over. Definetly needs to be some work done on this app.","Terrible app. Navigating is a nuisance. It's slow and finicky. It also keeps logging me out and removing my payment options on my account. In the 'upcoming releases' section, it never gives you any info other than date/time and an option to locate store. The whole point is for people to be able to purchase directly from the app (online), not to go to the nearest store using your location data. Overall, just a very poorly made app. Use a desktop browser instead to make your purchases.","Just stays loading... and finally a message stating \"wrong client for this refresh token\" what does that even mean?!😤","App is terrible. Anytime a big shoe drops the app crashed and you can't even use it. It's garbage. Only reason to have it is for the reward points if you buy lots of shoes.","Updated to flx points now i have points for things i would never want.

Sometimes when you're browsing and you apply filters, you can't scroll further down even though there are clearly more results to view. I agree with another review that if you back out of viewing a product to go back to your search results it'll send you back to the beginning.","This app was great. The only reason I gave it four stars because when I was purchasing I was missing something and it would not let me check out. It did not tell me what I was missing, it just would not process it. I strongly thought about just not making the purchase but kept combing through and eventually figured out what I was missing. Other than that, great app!","Quite possibly the worst Android shopping app I've ever experienced. I only suffered this because Macy's website never once worked for me using different browsers and different computers. So, I give it 1 star only because it somewhat functions whereas I could never once connect to their website. Returning to search results after cart add is horrible. App crashes, losses/forgets logon, the PayPal interface doesn't work. After submitting an order with app, Macy's canceled it w/o explanation.","With Good Internet Connection.

There are quite a few items that the store has that isn't in the app. Like the hashbrown patties for example. You need to be very specific or the app may not show you the item you need if it's on the app at all. Just a suggestion but what about adding pre made simple dinner recipes with a list of items. You can just add them to your cart instead adding every single item you need or editing them to your liking.","This app feels glitchy and unpolished. The worst bug occured when searches would reveal no data, I had to reinstall the app. Another annoying feature is how the search function doesn't remember your preference. Used to displaying from least to highest price? You will have to input that each time. The last seemingly unpolished aspect is how your last order items are displayed on the homepage even if they're unavailable. A real tease The delivery pickup was smooth, but this app glitches too much","Excellent shopping app! The Search menu is so helpful with a wide variety of search categories. Since Covid-19 the app has been further updated to show \"No Longer Available\" items. The delivery drivers are wonderful, always arriving within my selected time window; friendly, smiling & polite.","This is a really useful and convenient service that has saved me a lot of time for only a few extra dollars in my grocery budget. The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have had minor issues with some of my orders. For example, I have received cucumbers and lettuce instead of zucchini and cabbage. Or there have been instances where some of the items indicated as purchased on the receipt have not arrived. However, overall, this is a great app that provides a great service.","This refuses to add my purchases. The just for you list is rather confusing. and you can't see the current weekly ad here.

My other problem is that it detects nearly everything in my clipboard when I open the app. Numbers or words that are not tracking numbers. Between these two issues. I find the app lacking for my needs.","So far I like this app. I haven't had it long but I do have several deliveries, sometimes daily. I don't have to do anything, the app sends me updated tracking via notifications. Updates seem to be more current than the actual carrier's. I get tracking on some packages that I otherwise wouldn't have at all. Worldwide tracking.","Love it! The only thing I don't like is it is lagging behind a little it says something will be delivered today but really it's the following or it says delivery is expected 1 day, but its actually expected in 2 days. I think the update may have caused it, but other than that the app is great!!","I love this app. I can keep /almost/ all my tracking information in one place and receive notifications about updates. The only complaint I have is that when I enter a tracking number from something coming from overseas I get asked for an account number and traking key. Which I'm not sure it could be, and I can't track the package.","App has tracked about 99% of my packages! Works great, & saves all your past shipments etc 👌 *Edited because it's definitely NOT 99% of the time. Too many times it's entered the wrong one automatically - let alone not been able to identify it. Also, the auto- add clipboard thing isn't working anymore BUT! This app is still worth having for the majority that it does find.

I only just started using it about a month ago and my first payment isn't even due yet. I'm having a weird glitch though. I'll be on my phone doing something else in another app and the affirm app will flash on my screen for half a second like it's trying to load/open. I'm considering deleting due to it causing me concerns of potential hacking.","I use the app for miscellaneous items. Comes in handy for emergencies or items you may want immediately with the ease of paying overtime. Buy what you can afford. Maintain your budget, while not being blown up with crazy interest rates. Does not reflect on-time payments on your credit report so it won't help your score. But that's a given since the app does not put hard inquires on your score either. Highly recommend for responsible shoppers.","Was great, but something chaged. I have all bills paid off, 780 credit score, have never been late or missed payments. This showed me as being able to get $3500 three weeks ago, then it dropped to 1800, then 850, now it says 180. I haven't bought anything. I don't owe anyone anything. Weird, that it just decided to do that. I checked my credit from all three credit reports, and all is good, and the same it had been. This latest update doesn't even show your limit on the main page anymore. Ohwell","This app is super easy to use and convenient. The only thing that would make it MORE convenient would be partnerships with brick and mortars to accept Affirm in store. I tried to use the app at a massage salon and had to do alot of explaining because I paid online but they wanted to see the card when I arrived. I felt like I looked shady explaining the concept. I can't speak to what would be involved in making that work so I appreciate the available business model. I highly recommend Affirm.","not bad ar all. ive used it twice. once for a Drone and once for furniture. Update: 11\\7\\19. I have purchased sofas, drones, e scooters. Pretty much anything I want. I like the choice of 3, 6 or 12 payments options. Update April 2020: I have used this app for 4 purchases, 1 was almost 2K. But now during Covid they stop giving me credit despite paying off 3 of the 4 loans and having no issues.

I like PetSmart, but I have lost count of the number of times I've tried to use this app, over the past week. Only once did I get a confirmation # to indicate an order had been placed, but that's where it ended because a couple of days later, I was told by their Customer Service that the confirmation # didn't exist. Now when I select something it doesn't go into the cart, even though that part of the app worked before.","This app is great until you try to purchase something for online pick up. Also, it doesn't give you a chance, if you're an employee, to get you employee discount. I put items in my cart, and everything goes smoothly until I get to the step where I'm supposed to review my order before purchasing it, and later picking it up at the store. The button saying to review my order stays gray. It doesn't let me get past that point to finish my purchase.","Useless when you can't take anything out of your cart!!!! You can add all you want to the cart, but you can't remove anything! The 'remove' is overlapping the description of the items, so when you click on it, it seems like its gonna work, but then it doesnt! Such a colossal waste of time, considering I set up my whole profile and played the game to get coupons---which there is no way to add coupon to order either! Don't bother with this app, just order online","Update: they fixed the issue and now items will delete from check out if needed. They responded fairly quickly and fixed the issue within a day. Was able to get items that I needed. ----------------------------------------> It won't let me delete an item out of my cart. Making me buy an item that was in my cart but no longer need. Will just have to go elsewhere to buy what I need. Everytime I hit remove it stays up but says $nan.and still adds up in my total payment. Not worth the hassle.","This app doesn't work most of the time! It WILL NOT allow me to purchase Authority Indoor Kitten Chicken Entree Pate, 3oz wet cat food. Not at all, nor online! And, most of the time the cart doesn't work, just buffers. When it does work, it tries to force me to use PayPal instead of my credit card. Also, the app doesn't have favorites like the online. The 'games' tho cute, you can only use the coupons inside the store. So what's the point of an app?

At first, there were a few times it stayed on long enough for me to click a button or scroll down the home screen a bit, but mostly it crashes as it's loading my points on the initial screen. I have tried hard closing the app. I have tried shutting my phone down. It just doesn't work. At all.","Looks like the dev team has taken everyone's feedback to heart, because this app is great! I love my local Ace stores and am a frequent shopper who has been waiting for this for years. The only minor fault I have is that the fiery coal pic on the main page is a little distracting and I might suggest just replacing it with a plain stock photo of a store. I will be using this app on a weekly basis. Thank you!","I like the app. It needs a shopping list though. I can see all of my past purchases and I don't have to remember coupons. There is a wish list option when looking at items but I have no idea where the wish list is at. Good app if you shop at ACE Hardware","Updated: I tried once again to log after the response from the developers, and it works great. ------------- Just downloaded the app after receiving an email from Ace. Every time I try to log in, it just goes back to the login screen. I am able to log in via the website with no issue.","I previously wrote a review about the app being buggy. The developer responded that there was unusually high usage of the app that day. I finally gave up on the software when I couldn't even link to my long-held rewards account. I loaded the app again today and have had a better experience so far - although the app insists that you enter a 10-digit rewards number when every rewards card I have received has an 11-digit member number.

I probably scrolled past 200 items before coming across the 20% off coupon. Finding the coupon for the small tarp took even longer. By the time I found the tarp coupon I'd seen the same moving blanket and welders at least 9 or 10 times. Having a cart to put the coupons in is really convenient. Then I take screenshots, crop them and text the coupons to friends and family.","Just downloaded it a few hours ago. So far, I absolutely love it. I used to always laugh at my parents for cutting coupons out of the Sunday paper and was embarrassed when they used them at the store and I was there. Jokes on me apparently. If you actually keep track of everything you do from day to day that saves even $ .05, you would be stunned at how much you actually save just by using scissors, or downloading an app, or even molest a billy goat for a fair ride. Its all about the ☺.","I have found this app to be a very easy & convenient way to save money when shopping at harbor freight tools. I found the cart super handy for having all the coupons ready before going to the register. The customers in line behind seemed to appreciate the app as well. It made for smooth transaction without fumbling around looking for coupons...after using this app for over a year, it has saved me hundreds.","Awesome app...one request ..pinch to zoom in and out of the coupons? Easier to read that way...but otherwise GREAT looking app so far! Awesome to be able to save coupons to a cart, organized by coupon expiration date. Also great to be able to copy the barcode to paste into the HF website for purchase. Another awesome feature...it will notify you when a coupon is about to expire. Love it so far! Great work! Cheers! A blessed Easter to all in this bizarre quarantine time.","Use this app every time I go to harbor freight. I also get the catalog and mailers and this app is always up to date plus while in store I search the item number of an item I am wanting to purchase and more often then not there is a discount.

The home menu takes forever to refresh, my orders never show up on the designated screen. I can't changed my shipping preferences ( like overnight or 2-3 day shipping). There are a lot of bugs. The notifications are hit or miss because one release I'll be notified and the next release I won't even though I'll have it set for 15 minutes before release. Pleeeaaasseeeee fixxxxx this app like how you guys stay on it for iPhone users 😒","Horrible have to uninstall and reinstall to have any real updates and that's if I'm lucky because that sometimes doesn't even work. No history on purchases. Have missed many shoes because no notification if I'm waiting for the button to let me buy the shoes and by the time it finally pops up it quickly changes to sold out or goes straight to sold out bugs need to seriously get worked on","One day the app works fine, the next day it doesn't. Super inconsistent and it has been this way for YEARS. Its never the same issue, there is always something not working correctly. Today I was stuck on a loading icon for multiple minutes over 3 attempts while trying to get an exclusive release. Of course the shoe sold out while I was waiting so I never even had a chance. A few days ago I had no problem checking out for a release. Such garbage.","BUSTED. I have to log out and log back in to this app every few days or so to even see upcoming releases! It doesn't have any purchases that I've made other than maybe 2 of them? So I don't know if it has my points and status up to date. I've been LUCKY to get any drops, and I'm pretty sure the app has cost me at least 3 of them too. Please fix, I need my sneaks.","Very frustrating, as others mentioned the app doesn't work correctly when there is an important drop. Sometimes, at 10am EST the \"coming soon\" button automatically changes to \"sold out\" or it will say there is a temporary error and boot me out of my account. The idea behind this app is great but is exicuted very poorly. I have noticed it seems to work slightly better on the iOS version which is also frustrating. Pretty surprised that it has been like this for so long and nothing has been done..."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.nike.snkrs","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.nike.snkrs","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nike.snkrs&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.nike.snkrs/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.nike.snkrs/similar"},{"title":"Shipt: Same Day Delivery","description":"Shipt brings the store to your door with same-day delivery on grocery products, household essentials, beauty supplies, and more.\r\n\r\nShop from neighborhood retailers and a professional shopper will handpick and deliver your order, exactly how you want it.

Now when you click on an image, it's zoomed in to fill the screen & you can't zoom out. Also, when you upload an on-foot image yourself for a shoe that had no pictures uploaded previously, it doesn't even show up unless a second image gets added. The ability to delete an image also seems to have gone missing. This app definitely needs work.","After last update the \"Want\" section is not showing full list any more! Most of the shoes in this list disappeared even if when you find them via search at upper left of screen the Want button is black! I've tried to sort them again, but as I add more shoes at the end of list start to disappear again!","Good app although with the exception of the 3% fee StockX is much better. Pretty annoying that you can't check previous sales history for whatever size shoe you're looking at. Makes it difficult to gauge the market effectively. Honestly i only use the app because it doesn't charge the 3% buyer's fee and has excellent pictures of the product but if stockX got rid of their 3% fee I would go right back to them because of the information provided about the product and dollar increase bid ability.","One thing that disappoints me about this app is that for some reason i can't see what dates a certain shoe sold for and how much. It makes it a bit difficult to determine a reasonable price to list the shoe based on condition. Im using an android im not sure if thats the reason why, but please add this feature to androids. I know iphones are able to do this, but why can't androids ?","So Much for Air Max Day Constant \"Json\" crashing, can't even get the app to open. This happened on black friday too, completely unacceptable. EDIT: 3 Day \"Thank You\" sale Again, what a joke. The app says drops update at 10 AM Pacific (1 PM Eastern).

This whole app is awful. Everything loads so slow, it is so easy to clip something that you didn't mean to. Notifications for smart spins are often late and glitched. The store staff are never able to help when this app glitches and coupons don't come off, they can't do anything. I hate this app! I hate Family Dollar so much. I tried to give them a chance. I really did.","It's great to save on items.. that is, when coupons actually work. Often times coupons that match up to the items don't come off or coupons won't load onto a person's app, but will appear on other people's accounts. There's usually always issues with the barcode scanner and smart spins. Oh and there's a group of people (usually the smart couponers) find a way to sign up as an employee to get the employee discounts.. do y'all make sure they verify","The app is good when ur able to use the coupons. I would say 5 out of 10 the coupon I do have don't apply to the items I purchased. I even read the fine print and then I scan to make sure and it always says don't apply to this item and it's real frustrating. why is it when I put my number in the system it never works when a certain person rings me up? I went back and told her that my number didn't go through and she tells me to contact main office. But when I went back in to buy something it wor","Very disappointed in this app. 9× outta 10, a smart coupon will show an item is eligible when checking with the app- but once u get to the register and get ur final price, they do NOT come off and by then it's too late to do anything about it. It makes it very hard for people new to using coupons. It turns them away from even trying. Also- when u earn free spins for coupons, the coupons are for items NO ONE rly buys. It should go based on your past purchases or a simple $? Off $?! Horrible!","This app is ok. Coupons seem to be all for products that aren't in stock right now, like toilet paper. You win spins by purchases, but the prizes are the same coupons that are available in the coupon list. Which is kind of lame.

Then it tells me I am not the lowest ask. I then delete my ask and that one that was £1 below me magically disappears. I even tried submitting an ask about £70 less than the next ask. As soon as I submit then an ask with £1 less than mine appears. It is so frustrating - please sort it out. Selling with stockx is very straightforward usually.","Gave up after the 10th time I've entered my CC and shipping info only to have it enter it again this morning because it fails to save.

I have to change my password everytime I want to utilize anything personalized like the shopping cart or when I buy something... its incredibly frustrating. Meanwhile, the app shows I'm logged in with all my info. After a couple of attempts with my password I get locked out of my account. I save every password to an app, I know for sure I am using the correct password, as this is the only app I have this issue with.","**PLEASE!!! Fix the shopping cart. It was adjusting quantities on its own. Now shopping cart items don't save. It's useless as is. Menards is great. App, not so much. Item quantities multiply in the shopping cart. If I add 5 items, for example, and don't clear them within a couple days, soon are 10, then 40, then 400! Search engine is too broad. Entering a specific item description can bring up hundreds of items from different departments that have nothing to do with the description I entered.","Unreliable shopping cart. You can easily spend an hour or more putting project pieces together and adding them to your cart, only to find that when you go to your cart it is empty. Everything gone. You then have to start over from scratch. Also if you are logged into your account on a computer and the app, the shopping carts don't link up.. Aside from a faulty app, the processing fees at menards are rather high just to have them pull for pickup. Will adjust my review when this is fixed.","The app works ok, but product search results are far better on the website. I search for an item on the website & forgot to add it to my list. Searched for same product on the app & it wasn't there. I searched the website, found it & added it to my list. The product shows up when clicked on from my list in the app, but if you search it through the app using the Menards SKU or product model number it says not found. If you go through the department on the app it's still not there. Website it is.","It's okay if you're going to purchase things at the moment that you are using the app. But it won't store things in your cart for a later purchase. You can't build up a shopping cart and purchase the items later. I recommend this app if you're making a purchase at that exact moment but if you need time to get a shopping list together, the app doesn't work."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.menards.mobile","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.menards.mobile","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.menards.mobile&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.menards.mobile/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.menards.mobile/similar"},{"title":"Photo Print - Free Same Day Photo Prints App","description":"Walgreens photo print: Printing photos at Walgreens just got easy: download our app for free and start photo printing your mobile photos today! \r\nChoose your photos, your print size (4x6, 5x7, square …), and quantity.\r\nSelect your nearest Walgreens store for 1 hour pickup, or enter a U.S. postal address to receive them in the mail ($2.99 flat fee).\r\nGlossy and matte prints available\r\n\r\nTHE EASIEST AND FASTEST WAY TO WALGREENS PHOTO PRINT PHOTOS\r\nOrder prints on your phone in seconds, pick up and pay at Walgreens photo in 1 hour*!

I have my Amazon account connected and for the month of April 2020—none of my online receipts are accounted for. This is not the first time this has happened. I've uninstalled and reinstalled app, reconnected my accounts, but nothing works. There should be an option to reach customer service but this information is not available in the app. It takes a long time to accumulate points as well and a short period of time to upload receipts unlike some others.","Great idea earning points for taking pictures of your receipts. It just takes so long to actually gain the points even if you shop everyday to earn a gift card. I've been using it for three months now. Hopefully soon I'll have enough points for a gift card. 🙂 May 2020 Update....... I finally racked up enough points to get a $10 Amazon gift card. So happy, you all are awesome.","Challenging! I have successfully used this app for a while. I've had to update my connection for Amazon and email regularly as it doesn't seem to stay connected. Now it wont allow me to connect email anymore so that I am unable to cash out. Now I checked and neither Amazon or Google have any issues with my signing info but for quite some time this app says they do! I'm super irritated. I used to love and gave this app good ratings . I'm no longer supporting it!","I'd like to keep using this app but there's too many problems. I have a stack of receipts that I have been waiting to upload for about a week now. I can not upload because there haven't been any cards to upload them to. I have asked for new cards and was told that hardly anyone at ReceiptPal will be at work for 2 weeks. So what do i do when this stack of receipts expire? The point of this app is to upload receipts, not hold on to them. I'll find another app that is consistent. Thanks","I LOVE this app. Sure there are restrictions ans rules but its a great rewards service with an easy-to-use interface. Redemption is seamless and immediate. You can choose from \"Amazon\" or \"Retail\" (Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Visa, Starbucks, Lowe's, Home Depot, Fandango, and iTunes/App Store).

This release runs faster, performs better and is generally a notch better than earlier releases. Update today!","comments":["1) Why can't I complete online shopping from the app? Instead, I must go to website and complete the process there. (Well, at least I can find my lists there.) 2) Links to PDF manuals are not clickable. 3) Sometimes when I scroll through the search results and reach the end of page, I suddenly get an empty list and message 'no results'.","It became so frustrating using this app as well the website. Why did you split the buying process like this? It will be awesome at least having the shopping list from the app loaded on website. I spent a lot of time adding the same items on website and 30 minutes later the shopping list was empty. Even if the account its stored it keeps asking for authentication. IKEA I love your products but I hate your app and website. Please focus on one of them and make it work properly.","SO frustrating and cannot buy anything because of this badly designed app! Every single time I have to log in & my IKEA family card is not automatically connected. Half of my screen is always covered by store information & a cookies disclaimer and they *cannot* be removed. They pop back again after being closed. I save items in Favorites & on my shopping list and they're gone when I start another search. The pricing criteria is useless too: do you want to sort it ascending or ascending?","2/2002: Not updating it, current reviews sound worse. Old: Well, unlike some folks I can login, see my Ikea card, and do basic search type stuff. That said, the app lacks a bunch of really basic stuff (search history etc.) and is quirky... My current problems are (unlike the website) you can't download manuals... There's what looks like a link, but it does nothing. And I can't find store layout maps. It's probably for me more of a 3 * app... But I give it extra since Ikea is pretty great.","Two complaints: 1) When you scroll to the end of a results list, it refreshes and says there are no results at all. 2) It does not load different Shopping Lists when you select them. It gets stuck in the loading phase or says that it has finished loading but is still on the previous Shopping List.

I would like to see food labels pictured for those of us who rely on them to guide our healthy lifestyle. Order early. Please select a date/time, I picked First Available. Everyday that date gets pushed back. So much time has passed I keep adding food to the cart but it won't let me increase the tip. I have now picked a date hoping it will be on schedule. I wish you provided curbside pick up like the app say but that service is not available in our store. Be patient at home.","I liked this app until the past 2-3 weeks. Or seems to have some glitches going on. 1. The zoom in messes up or won't work at all when trying to get a better look at something. (It's not my phone) 2. When looking at each category the list doesn't go to the top right away, but goes very slow and jerky to the top. It will not let you scroll up. It will pop back down and do it's slow jerky scrolling itself. It's very frustrating. Will give 5☆'s when fixed.","Useless. You can't search by product (ie - mayonnaise), when you do find an item, majority are listed without price but rather \"see price in store.\" I want to be able to search all items on my list and have a good idea how much the total is before I go. Check out the Ralph's app for how it should be done. I love Aldi and am so disappointed with this \"app\" About the only functionality was to be able to look at the weekly ad.","This app is pretty good for making a list of the special finds you want to purchase. Previously, you could see the finds sorted in your list by which date they were released. Then you could see them sorted by release, though there was no date attached. Now it seems they are all piling together in one mixed up list, which is not useful. You can't delete items based on how old they are.","Not very helpful. I use this app to see what the special buys will be every week, but it no longer separates the list of saved items by date. It's a pain to try to remember which week everything I'm interested in is on sale. The grocery list feature is not user friendly. It would be nice to see what's available or not at my local Aldi.

There is a larger variety of sizes, colors, styles and discounts than in the store but the app is super slow it gets frustrating browsing around. Pages take forever to load, pushing the back button takes forever, lags, glitches just frustrating. If you already know what you want its fine for the most part. I like being able to see my rewards status but I've also had issues with the rewards as well and have missed out on several $10 rewards.","I am over the Moon that I can finally pay my credit card bill on my app! It's so easy! It use to be such a hassle. The only Star missing in my JCP Life is if I could get the option to receive my Rewards notice by text instead of email. I hardly check my emails and I have a ton so it would be perfect to get them in a text so I have it right there. Plus my store has bad signal. So when Im at the register, I have to go outside to find my email and then come back in. I hope you guy's can fix this.","App is great to get the coupons and extra discounts that are always available but using the price check scanner is extremely hit or miss, mostly miss. I've tried it on 3 separate devices running 3 different versions of Android and the problem is always the same... Open the scanner and the camera view is solid black so it can't \"see\" the tag to scan for a price. Clearing app and systems cache doesn't work nor does restarting app or device. Other than this issue the app is great.","This app sucks so bad. I have uninstalled and reinstalled 4x now. I don't know why I keep trying to use it. I have a total of approximately $819.00 worth of stuff in my cart and cant even open it up. This has happened numerous times.....so sick of it. Gonna uninstall again, finish paying my account balance. Guess what jcpenney goodbye...sick of trying. An app is supposed to make things easier.....NOT!!!","Any ease of signing up for an account is negated by that stupid birthday date method. If a person was not born in the 2000s its a pain in the ass. This should be obliterated. Just let a person type in their birth date OR have the drop down option. If someone knows how to use this annoying feature without FLIPPING through decades please let me know in your comments."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jcp","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.jcp","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jcp&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.jcp/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.jcp/similar"},{"title":"Newegg Mobile","description":"Upgrade your online shopping with Newegg!

I will reinstall one last time, hopefully it works, if not, it will end up in trash folder","Everytime I open the app to sign in it keeps telling me to change my password for my security. Just for today I changed my password 4x. So irritating. It still does it. I uninstalled and reinstalled and it's still doing it.","As others have said, items don't appear in the cart. I noticed they do show up later on after you've given up and used Pavilion's instead. Can't imagine how much money Ralph's is losing over this bug. Delivery charge for about 2 bags of groceries was $10 which is also too much when you add a tip.","Bad experience. No search capability.

Don&#39;t forget to leave us a review","comments":["I love Depop but come on guys...your app is constantly glitching, buttons aren't responding, windows are exiting randomly, draft posts are saving duplicates and the word count keeps jittering up and down even when I'm not typing!! It's a beautifully simple app and well designed, but the mechanics of it are incredibly poor and cause me a lot of frustration and wasted time as a seller. It has been this way for a long time...time for change!","I honestly am not sure what other users are complaining about.. only times I've had \"glitches\" was from poor cell service.. Any issues I've ever had on the app were with buyers trying to get everything for nothing.. All I know is, Depop has ALWAYS had my back or so I've felt. I'm not a top seller, and never have been so don't think that's why, like whether you've sold 1 item or 100, Depop makes you feel welcome, feel proud and feel free to be yourself and sell the way you want. xo","Still love the app, but now I have to wait until the word counter finishes tallying each character before I can do anything with a drafted post. And if I back out before the tallying is done, my post gets deleted and to have to restart from the beginning. edit: Now posts I make are deleted and a notification pops up saying \"not found\" so that's pretty cool :(","Very glitchy, when trying to upload an item after uploading the images the page will freeze, have to save it to drafts (it also creates multiple drafts of the one item) and continue writing the text where it will then freeze again, so I have to close and open the app, hoping it saved the description for the item to drafts so I can fill out the category, size, price ect. Drafts wouldn't show so I reinstalled the app, it just deleted all 20 of my saved drafts. Hate this app.","Im experiencing glitching. Would get 5 stars otherwise. When creating a post the post and save to drafts buttons do not work. It then starts scrolling down endlessly and eventually will crash. It doesnt matter how many times you close it and open it again, it does the same thing. And yes it is updated and I've tried uninstalling it. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.depop","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.depop","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.depop&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.depop/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.depop/similar"},{"title":"5miles: Buy and Sell Used Stuff Locally","description":"5miles opened a new channel called 5miles Dash.

I bought something from an \"auction\" just to try it out. The app sent it to my old address and I was out the money from May(purchase date) until almost January this year.

This is the ONLY reason I have the app. I DO NOT buy anything on 5mile anymore, I use offer up.","App has changed so much, it's just not the same. Pitiful views, no boost option except with coin rewards which are just a waste of time to complete, and why is this app using over 1G of my storage space? That's un heard of. The Dash feature needs to be monitored unless this is no longer a family friendly app, I mean items range from crotchless lingerie to bondage looking items and barely nude models showcasing these? Seriously guys, not family friendly at all","find anything you need on this app at awesome prices!!! EDITED: I live in the United States but for some reason when I try to share the link to friends or share the app for them to download, it says \"sorry this is not available in your country\" ??? So exactly what countries actually get the rewards for sharing the app with their friends? I will change my review back to 5 stars when I get a good reason for this. Other than is issue, I have loved the app so please let me know why.","It's been great so far. Easy to find what you're looking for, not many ads. Haven't sold anything yet but it hasn't been that long and I already received messages from people trying to buy my stuff.","I've noticed the app is filled with lots of scammers.

The latest iOS update includes a fix that resolves the login issue you might have encountered. Happy shopping!","comments":["Love the app but one recommendation I would give is to be able to select multiple size to the bag at one time selection. For example I have a 7 and 9 year old so it would be easier to select a shirt size for a 7 and a 10/12 at the same time. Instead of adding one item, clicking out of the pop up box and then making the next selection. Also, the favorites list should be next to the 'my bag' icon for faster access. I forget that option exist and mainly rely on the 'saved for later'. Overall great!","The lag is BEYOND frustrating. I spent at least 2 hours (not exaggerating) trying to scroll through the girls selection (filtered was about 678 items) and I know that I didn't even get to see everything because it kept crashing. And every time after it crashed, I'd have to filter again and scroll to where I'd last viewed items. And every time, I'd have to wait to scroll because of how terrible the lag is. It's AWFUL","Not sure how this update makes anything faster. It took me a few hours just to make an order of 15 items... I'm shopping for 4 kids and while the older version could get laggy, it definitely was more user friendly There's no more easy access to the favorites list, and searching and filtering is horrible. Editing your bag takes forever, now that you're prompted to save everything for later. Honestly, it's enough that I might look for another store for my kid's clothing.","APP is GREAT!! I have been having problems lately trying to check-out online. The system would not let me check-out. Message \"TRY LATER\" I saw this app, decided to download it, and I checked out in less than 5 minutes. Thanks for the UPDATE! I tried ordering earlier during the day and the site was jumping around. Came back later, saw the update, and downloaded it. 🎉 Placed my order. 😊 Sheila 🐝","🤦‍♀️The new update has made the app even worse and completely unusable. It won't let me check out AT ALL. It used to work but was just very tedious. Not to mention ha, yesterday I had 2 place bucks, and now today suddenly I only have one?! Wth lol? I even still have the physical copies of the TWO!.

The app itself is usually unresponsive, but the points are getting harder to earn & doesn't seem fair to redeem for anything worth $10 you could buy elsewhere. Pampers diapers, however is of true quality! But the rewards, eh. You could live with or without them. 😀","Update is garbage. I used to be able to actually see the rewards. With the update (they force you to download because previous versions are not accessible) I can't even view the rewards page. It's terrible glitchy. I used to love this app. It's sad bc I've used this app for four years and now it's basically useless to us.","Change for the worse - new points system is completely unattainable. I had been saving for one year to get nice rewards, like a photo album - now after the update all I can afford is a 5 dollar gift card. For a full year plus of buying diapers, I get 5 dollars. Now they don't offer any promos either. It's a waste unless you like shutterfly. *edit 4/19/20 - still garbage - no offers. Never any cash back options, why even have that in that on here?","app keeps crashing. when its working it is great and well designed. Update: 2/8/20 i havent been able to open the app for 2 months now. It is now completely un-usable. I had a lot of points on my account so this is extremely frustrating. Update: 4/10/20 app was updated and would open for about 2 weeks. Now will not even open again after last update. 5/5/20- attempted suggested fix. deleted app, restarted phone, reinstalled. app still will not work. will reach out to support for further help.","This app is sluggish, laggy, and frequently unresponsive. It doesn't always respond when I tap on a category in the rewards section. There's no haptic response to tapping on something, so you end up tapping repeatedly or tapping something else because you don't know if it's doing anything (a haptic response would be something like a click noise or the button lighting up to indicate you hit it). The only way I can see all the rewards I qualify for at once is apparently on the home screen because there's no convenient way to sort the rewards screen that way. To add to that frustration, the actual website changed the entire rewards section to just push the app on you, rather than let you view the rewards conveniently in a browser window. If I hadn't got a smartphone last year, I'd be unable to use my points at all because \"obviously everyone and their dog has a smartphone now, so why would you NOT want to use the app?\" I will say it was nice being able to scan diaper codes. Less so that there still wasn't a better way to enter the sometimes difficult-to-read wipes codes than manually typing them in. Overall, though, my experience with the app (and all its push notifications I couldn't figure out how to turn off) has been not great.

The company itself has gone downhill. Their \"Safe Line\" service is a joke and they have been adding multiple fees so you can't catch up on your account. I was told when I paid on Safe Line it would go onto my account. It was just to keep the account \"in the green\" as they tacked extra charges on for the 9 months I was on it. Plan on paying 2x the fee payment to get ahead on your account or the fees will be a month payment for a continual payment loop.","I've been using this app after looking at the books I get in the mail and when I need to get presents for the grandchildren and or family members! My fiance has also become a member of the Fingerhut family! If ever you are in need of building your credit, I encourage you to use Fingerhut and make sure you set up an automated payment for at least $5 more than minimum payment so that you don't miss a payment! Plus take advantage of the deferred payments that several times a year are made available","Great way to rebuild your credit. Prices should be considered gouging but again they approve you when no1 else will. Which I never got, if you have issues with ur credit you clearly are having money problems, whater the reasons, so let's charge those type of people stupid high interest rates so they can afford it even less than they could before!? Makes no sense to me. Should work with the people who are trying 2 fix their mistakes and give them discounts to draw them back I 2 using credit again","Good for rebuilding credit but not much else. Expect prices similar to places like Rent-A-Center. TV on amazon costs $110. Same one on Fingerhut will cost $170 but you get to pay $20 a month. Shipping is outrageous unless you spend $200 or more in one transaction.","Acc. Is easy to access. Low payments. I can search what I am looking for so I don't have to brouse through everything.

Pretty fulfilling, right? Not only is it sustainable and smart, it also provides endless hours of entertainment via browsing through other people’s stuff. Try it and you might discover something great that you didn’t even know you needed! \r\n\r\nTo make things easier, we show you stuff that’s nearby, while our unique auction system determines the winner through a fair and easy bidding system\r\n\r\nGiving items away is much easier than trying to sell them elsewhere. On GiveAway, you can add an item in just a few taps. Only the automatically selected auction winner can send a message to the giver, so you only have to coordinate with one person. Then, the winner will come and pick up the item!\r\n\r\nTo keep things fair, every user on GiveAway is awarded what we call Karma. Karma is your GiveAway currency to use for bids. Users earn Karma by giving away items and can spend it on items they covet. Using Karma, you can claim interesting items in the app. The more interesting your item is, the more Karma other users will spend to make it theirs - and thus the “bidding” part of GiveAway.\r\n\r\nThat’s how items are given away: the giver adds the item and just waits for the bid to take place. Other participants from the area see the item in their feed marked as “No bids”. The first person who wants it offers 0 Karma. A countdown begins, and so does the bidding. Other participants can offer more Karma if they want. The winner is the person who offers the most Karma before the timer expires. The more interesting the item is, the greater the amount of Karma that the giver will receive for it — and the more you’ll have to offer for an item you want!\r\n\r\nThe item is available in the feed as long as the timer is still running. The timer starts when the first person who wants the item taps “Want it” on the app. The duration of the timer is dynamically calculated, depending on the urgency that was specified when the item was added, as well as the time of day. For convenience, the timer never expires during the night (in the giver’s time zone). If an item receives a bid within the last 10 minutes of the timer, then the countdown starts from 9 minutes 59 seconds once again, so that anyone who wants to re-bid could do so.\r\n\r\nWhen participants offer Karma for an item, the amount of Karma offered remains frozen until the end of the timer, regardless of if they win the bid or not. If someone wins the item, their Karma is transferred to the giver when the item is handed over. If an agreement was not reached, the winner can refuse to pick up the item, or the giver can cancel the trade. The person who posted the previous bid will become the winner, and everyone else’s Karma will unfreeze.\r\n\r\nItems can be claimed for free, without Karma. But only if there is no one else who is willing to bid Karma to claim these items.\r\n\r\nYou can raise your Karma by giving items away, by bringing new participants to the app, and by supporting the project. Share items in personal messages and on your social networks, and also use the “Invite friends” function. You will receive bonus +1 Karma for every new participant that follows your link as soon as they log in to the app. For convenience, you can get started by using the “Raise Karma” button in your profile.\r\n\r\nWe are launching in San Francisco!","descriptionHTML":"GiveAway allows you to quickly give away things you don’t need, and quickly get things that you do.

Thank you for such a great shopping experience!

I can access it anywhere and rarely has glitches.","The app always freezes and then a message pops up that it has stopped. Then, when editing the cart, it freezes and a little round circle spins. It did it AGAIN today. I got curious as to how long the page would get stuck and that circle was going to spin after trying to delete stuff. Well, it spun for 1 hr. I ended up deleting the app and installing it again. I get tired of doing that! I've had to uninstall and reinstall this app about 10X's in 6 weeks. Unacceptable!","For once I was able to edit my cart & make a purchase. Have had continuous issues with editing my cart which would result in not being able to make purchase. Your response was as if you hadn't even read what I had written & after that didn't get response. Keeping my fingers crossed that it continues to work Another suggestion to improve the app, would be to allow you to move items from your cart into your favorites for a later purchase.

Also, I cannot edit shipping info or my wallet. I can only add addresses and payments. I cant even delete an old (no longer used card) that is still set as my default payment. Also there is no way to filter out store only vs online only until you open the item which sometimes takes a long while to load.","Very good app, the ONLY note I would have is that it'd be cool if you could favorite items that you don't want to buy immediately but want to be able to find quickly later on (I have lots of pets so some type of wishlist would be very useful since I can't buy everything all at once for all of them)","Great for ordering supplies but now having issues booking grooming appointments. The option to select a service only shows a bath description only & therefore there is no way to select which service I want to book. Updating has not resolved this ongoing issue & is extremely frustrating as I cannot even check for available appointments before having to call.","Search function and filters is utterly unusable, which is the primary purpose for the app. Its not any better on the website. Adding pets is neat, but as far as I can tell it doesn't really do anything with the pets you add.","It's okay, not great It too me 10 minutes, including a specific weird search, for a feeling prescription cat food.

Have had no issues with the app at all. Within a 3 week time span I have already earned enough for a $10 gift card. Which I will be saving :) There are a lot of incentives and you aren't having to spend more money that you are going to anyways when making a trip to the store. So I'm not having to \"buy into\" a program for rewards. My kids have fun scanning the groceries, we sometimes play grocery store with the non cold items, before I put them up. Great for the whole family!","I just downloaded this app. My first experience was fun. I used yesterday's purchases to try this out. I found that going over the cost of each item helped to remind me to take care with the purchases I made. (I bought dog treats. I tend to give him too many in a day. Now I'm breaking them into smaller pieces) * I would appreciate it if you could add the larger keypad everywhere you expect us to put in a date or year etc. The scrolling up and down is tedious.","So far so good. It does take a little more time then I expected to earn points which makes it take even more time to earn rewards. I do alot of shopping each week & I enter each item I buy each time I go shopping, but from what I can tell I've only received points for one shopping trip each week which seems unfair to me. I feel like I should have way more points then I do. I think it's stupid that y'all only view shopping trips once a week (which is Sunday) & I only receive points for one.","This app has given me the hope of actually being able to make a couple extra bucks without the nitpickyness of all the other so called cash makers which never quite let you make a dime. I have already gotten a $10 amazon gift card and am half way to another in the first 6weeks but it is alot of work scanning every bar code for all your shopping.","I've been this for years. You scan what you buy and do short surveys and get points to buy things or gift cards. It takes time to accumulate the points. I've cashed in a total of $300 or more over the past years. Money is money. Just saying.

This is most likely as there is no login button after you initially set up the app. This would remedy this issue as the errors are happening because it does not have our login info. The app basically resets itself and the only way to reenter login info is to uninstall and reinstall the apps again. Did this 3 times already to get it to work. Hopefully this can be fixed soon.","The worst app ever! Constantly gets stuck and logs you out of your account. The developers really need to do some work on it, like ASAP!","It worked well prior to the last update. Now, whenever I try to add a pair of shoes to my shopping cart, it constantly gives a :Hook Error\". I've uninstalled, erased all files, and reinstalled. Its still the same issues over and over.

I want to be able to see even the ones that sold, so I can look for similar cars/features in the future. Currently, I have no idea which items were sold or taken down of the 13 missing saved cars on my list, and THAT'S frustrating.","This app is VERY BAD when you try using it on a tablet device. The whole design is way off and makes you want to zoom out even more than the maximum amount you are allowed to on the app. Makes it very difficult to look around for cars, I would rather recommend using the website. Not worth the time to download.","This use to be my favorite auto sale app. I've used it for along time. And have bought several cars I found on here. But the filters have become useless. Showing cars way above my price range. Or hundreds of miles outside my distance settings. And before Cargurus responds, I know how to use the filters. And have been for a few years.","This app does not show cars that are in the filters I have selected. I specified a range from 4-8k with a manual transmission and all this app does is keep showing me cars that are way over that price and are automatics. This app is beyond frustrating and I will not use until it is fixed. Also, please remove the zoom button in the bottom right hand corner. I can't save my search since it is in the way. In my opinion this app is completely useless.","Whoever does their coding is no guru! Price and Distance are seperate search tools from the rest of the drop down menu. You cant use all of the available search options in a single search. When you click on price or distance you are not given all of the regular search options from the initial drop down menu making specific searches useless. Geeze!!!

Both have delivery charges and minimum orders which would add to cost. Seems to randomly add items to Amazon even though I was browsing Morrison store. DUnable to see delivery options until AFTER shop is complete. Ended up by abandoning whole shop. Confusing waste of time and nowhere to query with Amazon. Will stick with Asda, Tesco or Sainsbury.","The service is great, the app is dismal. Like so many other Amazon apps it takes a long time to load, and regularly freezes or doesn't load content below the header. Frustrating. Checking out often involves several minutes of clicking around and restarting the app just to persuade it to load the basket contents. I don't know why this affects so many Amazon apps. Maybe they're packed with unnecessary tracking code.","Fine if you enjoy shopping, and never getting your items. App needs the ability to reserve a spot for delivery, then give you a timer to complete your cart. More often than not you spend an hour picking out shopping items, only to find out there's no delivery available day after day. Buggy slow crashes and freezes a LOT. Be careful! there's no way to change a payment after you've submitted an order and no way to just directly rerun an order. You have to manually select each item again","Yes, this app is buggy as Hell and I have experienced several issues other users have described. The very worst for me was the random removal of items from my cart. I say random because in my case they were not all items that were out of stock because I could re-add them to my cart. Very annoyed after I placed my order I realised that something I really wanted had been removed and of course once the order had been placed no chance to add to it. And it was in stock! Please sort your app out.","The only positive experience is that I get whole foods delivered. Every single experience within the app is frustrating, unintuitive, and lacking. There is no list features, or the ability to star anything, so each time you need to go through to find what you are looking for. You can see your previous purchases, but lists or stars would be much easier. Reviews can only have 500 characters, so I can't go into every terrible experience I have with this, but it's terrible"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.amazon.now","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.amazon.now","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.now&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.amazon.now/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.amazon.now/similar"},{"title":"Banggood - Easy Online Shopping","description":"Welcome to the Brand new version of Banggood mobile shopping app. Enjoy the unique discounts on your mobile phone and experience the fun of the new Banggood with millions of users.

However, the customer service experience is abysmal. I had been corresponding with their Customer Service rep, Michał Borowiec, and at the beginning he was very pleasant and eager to help me resolve my sync issue. The last response I received from him was on the 27th of March. I replied to him on the 29th of March, then after hearing nothing from him after several days, I followed up on the 9th of April politely requesting an update. After several weeks of waiting, I followed up yet again on the 25th of April with still no response. On the 29th of April I sent another email voicing my displeasure of being ignored, but still nothing. I was going to purchase the full version of this app, but after the terrible customer service experience I find this highly unlikely.","Had an app similar to this before but this one I absolutely love!!! I use it every time I go to the store because it is WAY better than having to keep up with a paper list and a pen to mark the things off of the list..I am a type of person who has to have a list or I forget something every single time...So, definitely 5 stars for this app and I even told my family about It!","Fantastic app for groceries! Able to share with my energetic husband and he can mark things off the list in real time. I don't have to ask if we got everything on the list, I can see in a glance what we are missing. Also great for organizing by category (what else do we need from dairy?). Also a great app for trip packing, remember to bring charging cords! Very customizable and easy to use. Love it!!!","Perfect for doing shopping lists, I always leave my list at home but take my phone with me so this is the perfect app. The only critical point is that when you use it off line it keeps alerting you to put your wi fi on, which can be quite annoying. And I like the fact you can move items from list to list so if you don't get what you want in one place you can pop it in another list. The other point is the add at the bottom of the screan cover the bottom item on your list.","I have used several over the years. This seems to be one of the better ones. Really like that there is an online account and list access. Many do not have that. The GUI and options/setting could be better in several ways. Not very intuitive for the creation of new categories online, better in the app. Dark mode would be great. Also, how the heck do I make the rices show by default for all lists? I keep having to turn this on as all lists default back to hiding the prices."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.l","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.l","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.l&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.l/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.l/similar"},{"title":"Nordstrom: Shopping, Clothing, Shoes & Handbags","description":"Nordstrom is a leading fashion specialty retailer, offering customers one of the most extensive selections of clothing, designer boutiques, shoes and accessories.

I cannot even access items on my wishlist! What's the point?!! Needs a lot of improvements, really slow! Wishlist needs to be native to the app, NOT a website shortcut, but is better now that we can actually edit it.","When you save items to yourwish list and want to see full details, the link is broken. This version is as slow as the last one.","When switching away from your app and returning to it, it reverts back to the main screen, which is incredibly frustrating. Also when sharing to other apps, like wishlist apps, it doesn't pass the name of the item or any images to it. Try having your app developers share an item to the Wish Explorer app and you'll see what I mean. Your app needs to \"play nice\" with other Android apps, like the Amazon app does, in order to impress me and earn a higher rating or better review.","Just awful interface when you actially go to checkout. Items will disappear, samples will be in your cart one minute and then gone the next. Had to re-enter my shipping address even though it's already saved in my address book. Shipping option was stuck on express shipping and wouldn't let me click on free standard. Overall this was a horrible experience and it made me give up on making an order all together!","App asked if it can send a code to my email, which is fine, however it lacks the ability to hit send.

I have emailed their customer support 3 times on the same issue, using their customer contact system on the website, and have heard nothing back. I am STILL experiencing the same issue with my Elite membership. I was charged for my first box in April, and was told it would arrive April 25-30th. It still hasnt arrived. I wanted to 1) make sure it was still coming and 2) make sure I wouldnt be charged again in May for the same box. First impression is not good at all.","I like this app - but the draw back is that there isn't a way to save a wishlist or select items you may want to purchase but aren't sure of yet","Love that y'all carry plus sizes and so many choices. I really love all that you have for us plus size women only thing I wish you carried better selection of swimsuits","I love the adore me app! It's so easy to navigate and find what you are looking for. The bra/panty options are always either super cute or super sexy, i have a hard time picking because i love them all! They are also comfy and fit perfectly! The sleepwear is cute and comfy and the lingerie is always on point. I cant say enough great things about this app and company! Girls if you are looking for a great place to shop for bras, panties, pajamas, and lingerie look no further than Adore Me!","I love the Adore Me product line! The best part? How you get to pick and choose sizes (and often styles) when purchasing their bra & panty sets! While they do carry a huge range of bra sizes, it seems like the more uncommon ones are almost always sold out, which is even more of an annoyance when you actually realize just how small of a selection they offer regarding non-standard sizes . . . If i didnt encounter \"sold out\" as often as i do, it'd definately be a 5-star rating."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.adoreme.android","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.adoreme.android","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adoreme.android&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.adoreme.android/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.adoreme.android/similar"},{"title":"HSN Phone Shop App","description":"The award winning HSN Shop App for Android is everything you know and love about HSN, right on your mobile phone or tablet!

When I go to look at the order they let me know that none of the items that i purchased are left available at that price. My question is why do they advertise at that price?

Text reminders are wonderful. I love that if pay periods fall on awkward days you have the ability to reschedule if needed (first time is free!). I know it is expensive for businesses to make available for customers due to the fees they have to pay. That makes me sad as I wish more businesses had it available for customers who don't want to bust out their interest rate credit cards.","So far purchasing items through Sezzle has been so much easier on me. And the fact that there isn't interest involved puts my mind further at ease when buying collectibles. And what's more out of the 3 \"by installment payment\" Apps that I have downloaded, this is the only one that offers the option of rescheduling future payments in case I can't make the deadline. That type of perk is why I'd recommend this one highly for its flexibility.","Great app. Gives payment reminders for date, amount, and for which product. App is super easy to navigate.

I used to get to coupons directly, now it needs several clicks. And why do I need a need a pop up screen that tells me in which store I am when I open the app?

Also, it keeps opening the keyboard after I close in-app notifications or pop up screens but it keeps the keyboard closed when I click into the search bar. Why?","Edit: I posted my 2-star review yesterday due to some errors I received when logging in to the app. Today, the problem I had was fixed. I actually use the app and Clicklist often so this is a huge relief. Awesome job, Fry's! Old Review: I like the app when it works and use it often. After the update yesterday, it won't accept my password. I can log into the website fine so I know it's not operator error.","It's slow when you're at the checkout line. 1. Look for and open app 2. If app was recently updated be prepared to have to log in at checkout. No rush, I'm sure no one minds waiting for you. 3. Wait for it to load 4. Scroll through app to find the pay option 5.

I haven't been able to use in over a week. Seen other reviews and I'm not having password issues. I can't get into the app. Error message says app stopped. And this message randomly comes up when I'm on my phone. PLEASE fix the issue.","Since your latest update, this app will not allow me to log in. Gives me an error message every time.

It also only allows me to pay through gift cards, which is just ridiculous! This is the only app I am aware of where I can't pay with a credit/debit card, PayPal, or Google pay. At least one of those options should be available. iPhones can use Apple Pay in addition to gift cards, but that's still ridiculously limited.","The credit card auto-reload never works properly. Whenever I try to add funds I get an error message... only to find out later that it actually had deducted funds from my credit card and created a NEW gift card for each attempt. This happened twice. I spent 30 mins on hold to speak with a VERY RUDE customer service agent to get them to merge all of the unwanted gift cards. I was told this isn't a known issue. The other reviews here say otherwise! Ill deleting the app once my balance is used up.","First, you have to battle with Xfinity wifi in the Wawa store asking you to sign in when trying to open the app. Once you get the app to open it takes another 30 seconds to load your information. Then another 30 seconds to pull up your rewards card and then another 30 seconds to pull up the gift card. Meanwhile, you have 10 people behind you cursing and rolling their eyes. FIX IT!","Every attempt of clicking reload on a digital gift card produces a new digital gift card. There is no ability to use multiple digital gift cards to complete a purchase. So to use the last $2 or less on each card I had to go to a cashier to buy a new gift card for the exact amount of the total of all balances. What a hassle. The app saves my credit card, but doesn't allow me to just pay with the credit card. I have to buy a gift card with the credit card first. Rewards can't be used in app.","Wawa, great food, lousy app. I tried ordering in the app but my gift card didn't have enough of a balance, so I tried to reload it but instead of adding the funds to my existing card, it gave me an entirely new card.

I just wish with MOVE that Dick's would update the system to where I can use Samsung Health to sync my walks. I shouldn't have to download this app to download another app to sync the two apps together in order for my steps and mileage to be accounted for. With the technology we have now not only should you have Fitbit, you should also have Samsung and Apple. Not everyone has a Fitbit nor does everyone want to download extra apps.","Well it works part of time. I usually get my points only once I awhile I dont All this week I got my points but shows no activity which is confusing. And my sister does it and she has a 15 day challenge to earn extra rewards I dont. I hope because it doesn't think I'm doing any activity","The shopping experience is good but the extra feature lack range. The inability to sync Androidwear devices or to Samsung health is a big minus.","Great if it actually works 😑 ; thank you for the follow up, the issue was with my Fitbit syncing with the app adding my steps it was great motivation until it stop counting my steps...","I have no problem with the app itself. My grievance is with using my scorerewards card. Its absolutely ridiculous that you can't use it online to buy anything. All I want to do is buy a club, golf balls or gloves. Have them sent to my home instead of having to drive an hour to closest store. I've done my homework and decided to say screw it and buy a new 3w. But with stores closed I can't right now. Won't be able to get reward points using a cc instead of a store card.

It makes it easier to make purchases and divide the payments up into 4 payments. Without Quadpay, I wouldn't be able to make some of my purchases all at once. The only thing I don't like about Quadpay is that even though I have had many orders thru them and paid all of them off early, they lower your limit instead of increasing it. I just wish that, with good solid payment history with them, they would gradually increase your limit, not lower it. Otherwise, all orders great!!","I love this app and the ability to split some purchases into 4 payments. So far, I have paid off one purchase and my spending limit increased. I don't know if it will increase again. One thing I noticed is that when you go to browse the sites on the app, a few of them did not work, like Amazon. I tried to add certain things to my cart and it would freeze up or it would not add the product at all. Also, my husband was denied when signing up but we aren't sure why as all you put is your phone #.","Amazing app. I love being able to cut my cost into 4 easy payments. Helps out alot especially when I schedule it for my pay week lol. I only have 2 issues. 1: I can't ask for an increase which sucks cuz I spend money lol and I'll spend more if I had more credit. 2: I can't purchase from more than one store at a time even with having credit to spend. That's just wack. But the app is convenient, easy and flexible. I can't really hate it at all. Love it!!!","Since the endless looping has been fixed I love this app. It has saved me so much interest instead of using loans and credit cards and I can get everything I want or NEED in four payments. I do not mind the dollar fee with each payment because this app unlike it's competition gives you a credit line and doesn't change your limit or block you randomly Everytime you re-enter your information. You have a limit. You use it. You pay. You have your limit back. I love you quadpay.","This is my second time using Quad pay, and my first time using the app. I used it to buy an item I've been watching for about a year and I waited for it to go on sale. The app was easy to use. I was only given a certain amount to borrow which was less than I needed. There wasn't a way for me to spit the payment when checking out in the online store, so that made it confusing. Thank God I was in the physical store I was shopping online at, so I bought a gift card to cover the difference.."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.quadpay.quadpay","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.quadpay.quadpay","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quadpay.quadpay&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.quadpay.quadpay/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.quadpay.quadpay/similar"},{"title":"Smith's","description":"Looking for a faster, easier, more rewarding shopping experience?

Items mysteriously vanish from the cart or don't get put into it at all. It never gets fixed either, this has been going on for years. Less of a problem when I can go through the store and grab what I need myself. It's a much bigger issue when you can't due to a global pandemic.","Smith's finally got this right. The latest update is finally useable with better layout. The Google Assistant integration is excellent and the command list is well organized. This is now a well crafted and useable application unlike the order version which were user hostile. Latest update is garbage. Forces unwanted password reset. The reset does not work. Application is now totally useless.","The only part if the app that seems to be ordered right is search. You should search everything from the home screen. If you try to find things using the guided menus you wont find what your looking for unless you just want to skim through all the stuff the should have in store. Took me 5 minutes to find noodles. Also you cannot add to a shopping list so you're stuck just looking everything up in store. Smith's, go use the Home Depot app and either mirror it or pay them to make yours.","App crashes constantly, won't let me sign in, says email or password is incorrect but yet I use the same email and password on my PC, works every time on my PC. Won't let me link to my Google account to sign in either. Says error accessing link for Google. Very frustrated with this app. UPDATE, now it wants me to change my password. I do not want to change my password, there is no need to reset my password. I don't want to log in as a guest I want to log in with my own password","Love that I can choose my coupons and it's all done digitally without having to actually clip coupons. Seeing my purchase history is very helpful. I've saved so much money over the yrs with the coupons. Never really had an issue with the app minus it saying that the store has an item but yet I can't find it and this was pre lockdown. My issue now though, why it's not 5 stars, is the nutrition label tab on the items is blank, nothing under it, been like that for at least a couple of weeks now."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.smithsfoodanddrug.mobile","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.smithsfoodanddrug.mobile","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smithsfoodanddrug.mobile&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.smithsfoodanddrug.mobile/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.smithsfoodanddrug.mobile/similar"},{"title":"Under Armour - Athletic Shoes, Running Gear & More","description":"Our best gear.

However, this app never picks up the machines, never. I always have to restart my phone twice before any machines are picked up even if I'm right in front of them and then I have to fight the app saying that they're out of range. I'm so sick of it, at this point it's easier to get the coins.","Being able to do laundry without coins is wonderful, but that's all that's good about this app. For starters, it heavily advertises the California lottery, with in-app popups, and outside notifications. Among other UI issues, the machine selector screen scales badly, often leaving much of the screen unusable. Every time I exit the app, it resets my default launcher, which is a bug I've never seen elsewhere. I haven't looked at the other features, because I haven't absolutely needed to.","Now advertising spam about lottery tickets via push notification. It was formerly just a helpful, albeit somewhat buggy, app that was better than quarters, but I don't want my laundry app trying to sell me lottery tickets via push notifications. It doesn't implement notification channels at the system level to disable these from the notification, they just group them all together in one category. I've disabled the play tab, let's see if that stops it (but that option's not discoverable at all).","I love the convenience of never having to go get change. After 6 months the app has kept accurate track of payments made and over-all has saved me a ton of time. My only complaint is that the machines I use at my apartment vary the charge based on cold-warm-hot & light-medium-heavy but the app doesn't take this into account. It's up to you to put in the correct amount.","I love that I'm no longer burdened by carrying around rolls of quarters. However, that being said, I have a few criticisms. The app disconnects every so often, and you can't transfer funds from one phone to another; so when I updated my phone the PayRange balance I had was stuck on the old phone, so I'm kind of SOL with the remaining $1 or so that's on there. It would be nice to implement an option to use up the balance you have before adding more."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.payrange.payrange","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.payrange.payrange","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.payrange.payrange&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.payrange.payrange/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.payrange.payrange/similar"},{"title":"LightInTheBox Online Shopping","description":"The latest LightInTheBox App can easily take you through a fantastic shopping journey.

There was a password glitch, but the developer fixed it quickly and all is well! I've used this app for the past few years; really helpful, and I'd hate to have to shop without it! My favorite features are having product in-store locations listed, digital coupons being shown along with each item, and online ordering. Thanks for a great app!","Generally a nice app however since the last update I am not able to stay logged in, and when I try to log in it makes me change my password every time. I hope they will update soon because I can't keep this up! I have seen they are saying they have fixed the app but I'm still having problems, even after uninstalling and reinstalling. It was working a bit earlier but now is making me reset my password again. Please please please fix it, I depend on this app for shopping for 3 families.","As of a few days ago, I have been having issues with signing in. It doesn't recognize my password. I would then get locked out and asked to reset my password. Once my password is reset, I can log in then it signs me off. When I try to sign in, it tells me that my password is invalid and I have to through the whole process of resetting my password again. This is my third time doing it and I am now uninstalling my app. It's such a shame because I loved it when it was working.","The app is poorly designed without the user in mind. The lists are a \"crib toy\". When an item is added to the cart the app does not remember the user's place, returning to beginning rather than to where the user was. Confirming changes to an order does not show the changes, requiring the user to bail out of the confirmation to see the changes. Allowing substitutions applies to the entire purchase rather than individual items. Modifications sometimes delete the original order. They hate us.","This app told me everything in my cart was available, but my husband decided to just go inside the store and he could only find two items. So frustrating. I can understand an item or two, but almost the entire list? I guess I'll go back to using the Walmart app for pick up."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.fredmeyer.mobile","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.fredmeyer.mobile","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fredmeyer.mobile&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.fredmeyer.mobile/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.fredmeyer.mobile/similar"},{"title":"Cash Back & Rewards for Online Shopping: Shopkick","description":"Earn rewards and get FREE gift cards with Shopkick!

You did an update, making it so when we get a kick in the discover section it now vibrates. You've made this vibration unstoppable. No setting in the phone or with the app will stop it from vibrating. I've tried it all. I hate vibrate, I don't use it for anything.

It's very unnecessary!","*EDIT: I appreciate the response. I'll add your stars back...but I'm watching you Shopkick ;)* 2 star: Oh No! I used to LOVE this app! But political ads? No-freaking-thank-you! The app itself is cool. I love the concept and I use it when applicable. But, forcing me to watch biased political ads for points...WRONG! This is a grocery/shopping app...no room for pushing your mess in my face. Nope. Wow!","Great tool to earn credits to apply to gift cards. Sometimes have issues with walk ins or scanning a product, especially scanning at Best Buy. Not sure why but scanning the product at BB will comeback with the error wrong item yet it matches the description on ShopKicks. But other than that it's easy to use","Ok...I'm sure my shopkick points have been taken from me by now...I'm so done with this app...I've tried resetting my password...I have the correct email...tried verifying my device and I'm still not able to log into my account to redeem my gift card...I've tried emailing at the help desk but all it tells me is page can not be found 404...what gives shopkick team...this is slack","I purchased a new phone and wanted to use shopkick on it.

I like the overall ease of use. Much better way to shop, I've improved my wardrobe a ton using this! Delivery takes a long time, so can't use if you are in a hurry. Only problem: when I try to view my prior orders, I can only open one. Then, the others will never load. The only way for me to view them is to exit out of the app and then open the orders screen again. I have a Samsung Galaxy android phone. I wish this could be fixed. Other than that, great app!","Nordstrom has serious technical errors that haven't been fixed in years. It will have items listed for sale that are apparently not for sale but they will keep them up for sale for months. I would say about 1 out of 10 items you will purchase are actually available. You will eventually get refunded but its honestly not even worth shopping here anymore. I used to shop at Nordstrom Rack online all the time but its just too frustrating and I am not giving them another penny until they fix this.","Warning: it is easy to spend a LOT of money here! So many pretty things! The app is easy to use, and there are frequent deals and coupon codes. You can also pay your credit card bill from the app, I believe. Easy and fun.

Sometimes when you're in the \"my ShopRite\" menu and press the back button, it will go to the \"more\" section inexplicably. It's as if the people who designed this app never used it or tested it out. Very frustrating. Please work on this app, because the other features are pretty useful, especially being able to load digital coupons. That, and being able to make a shopping list with real-time prices so I can budget before I even go to the store.","This app is ridiculous. I have downloaded it on an iPad... only for it to stop functioning all together. It will open to title page, then force itself to shut down. Next... I tried to download on an Android mobile phone. The app worked briefly, but will no longer load digital coupons. Now that I am on a PC from home... the site will display the digital coupons, but is unable to \"load\" them to my account. The whole experience of shopping at ShopRite AS A WHOLE has become ridiculous thanks to their efforts at failed technology. If you shop on a budget... like most... you really need to take advantage of weekly sales to keep it affordable. Unfortunately, many of those \"sales\" are linked to digital coupons. If the coupon is not loaded to your account... no discount. It is beginning to feel almost as though I am held hostage by this technology, hoping for the site/app to function properly so I can load my coupons, do my shopping, and then go about my day. Dare I say... this experience has turned my loyalties towards WalMart where everything is reasonably priced EVERYDAY (no digital BS required!)","Great except very hard to get a delivery slot. Could there be a que, shoppers account would identify desired day and time. System would match next shopper in que with next slot that matched their desire for delivery. Could have separated que for pickup or delivery; small order or large. Shopper with small order pickup should be able to get faster service. This may reduce need for very large orders made because it takes too long to get slot. Ed","Used to be able to get pick-up or delivery slots without any problem. Now impossible as when slot open up for pick-up or delivery they are all sold out before the New day is even displayed. I suspect that the company's Shipt and Instacart are somehow locking up all the reserve slots making it impossible for regular customers to get in. This is gone on for a week now and I can't get a slot and shopping order filled by you because of it. I am now locked out of being able to use your store services","I am not happy with the app. The categories are not simple. You have to look through the whole circular instead all on one page. The digital coupons are difficult to find. Trying to set the location of the store is ridiculous. It never seen to accomplish at all.

I force my boyfriend to download it too. He was hesitant but now loves the app. We look at ads and clip coupons together. With just one touch your coupons are clipped and sent to a folder making them easy to locate when needed. All of my favorite local stores are on here. It's easy enough for my elderly parents to use. (They have a hard time using a computer mouse!) This app has more features than I thought. Im glad I gave it a try.","I used to really enjoy this app, especially the list feature, which I used to be able to open the app and just look at my list without turning my data on. Since my last update, I now have to turn my data on, plus enter my postal code and wait forever for it to \"find my local flyers\" before I can even select to just look at my list. It's pretty annoying and I will probably be deleting the app all together. I used to recommend it, but not anymore. Very disappointing, hope it can be changed.","I don't go grocery or any kind of shopping without a visit to flipp. No need to lug ads around. You will find them all right here in this one App. My husband will say, who has Coke products on sale. I go to the magnifying glass, click it, enter Coke, instantly a list of which stores have it at best deal. We Love Bilos 5 for $10.00. You will Love this Ap. Try it!!","At this time when flyers are becoming rarer, Flipp has helped me to keep shopping the way I am used to shopping and saving me money as a result. I love the fact that I can click on an item and it goes into my shopping list.","I've saved a lot of money with this app. I like the search feature to find sales.

Within the last few days, regardless of if I'm on wifi or data, the app fails to load into the registry at all. Came to the play store to write the review, saw there was an update. Update still did nothing, the app still won't load at all. Scanning is hit and miss, it seems this app does not sync into Target's main inventory like the Circle app does.","Suddenly says it can't retrieve my registry. Came on here to check it out and there was an update, but it didn't change anything.","Easy to use and so much fun","I personally do not like this app. It was better when it was all in the Target app itself. You have to remove items that are no longer for sale manually because it doesn't do it automatically. There are tons of items listed in the app that aren't actually available through Target. There's even times when I try to add items while in the store and it tells me the items don't exist. I wish they would have just left this in the original Target app so we could add items to our registries from there.","App truly and honestly sucks which is really a slap in the face because i love target so much and thought the app would be really convinient for me shopping from home. Ill go to click on the bigger picture to get more details and nothing will show up. In other words the images for anything wont show up sometimes at all and its really frustrating.

There's no way to enter it as payment and you can't place an order without a card. It says enter valid visa or mastercard. It's also sending me to Rolla Mo. I've changed it multiple times and it keeps going back to that address for pickup. Thanks for nothing. Oh...fyi..Chase pay ISN'T EBT.","I hate the new app. It is not user friendly anymore.

I have used the photos of a receipt to get my money back on an item because I had thrown the receipt away. I am up to my 3rd cash in point. £15 for snapping some photos. Brilliant app. Tried others but I was restricted to certain outlets, receipt hog gives you a reward for every receipt, something's it's a few pulls on the slots game but at least it's something.","Can't make anything. I have had this app for 2 years. In that amount of time you would think that I would have enough to cash out but no such luck. If im lucky I make $.02 If the slots were worth it I would consider staying but if things don't change I will uninstall it. I've tried reconnecting my Amazon and it keeps telling me that I have already connected an account but I only have one Amazon account and it isn't connected. It hasn't been for a couple of months now","Receipt Hog is a great app where you can earn rewards like an Amazon gift card just by scanning your receipts from food shopping, gas, clothes, quick meals at Wawa and Quick Chek. You can also win prizes with the slot machine including the largest receipt you scan. I just redeemed my points for an Amazon gift card. Try it. You'll like it.","Love the fact that you get points or sweepstakes entries for all receipts scanned. No more only getting points for certain items and brands like other receipt apps. It's a fair point system and doesn't take long to get a gift card. I also like the fact there are other ways to earn points as well. This is one of best receipt apps to download.","It's alright. There's times when it won't give me reward points for local restaurant receipts and that's annoying. But I have managed to get Amazon gift cards.

It'll delete your list when you ask to delete an item. It'll create redundancy of an item already on your list. It'll also add an item to your shopping list that is on the already purchased list. It's a bad user experience. It also has no functionality to do home deliveries with the other home delivery apps, so if you want to shop for pricing from home, don't use this.","The app has had problems in the past that I did not expect from Google, but it seems that it's solved now. Now I find it even easier than Amazon to browse. Still shipping takes longer than Amazon, but I can find many items like pet supplies cheaper here. \"The app was working fine, but now as soon as I choose my cart, the app shuts down and closes itself everytime. Completely useless. The problem has been going on for 3 days now, even after I reinstalled the app.\"","Got to love this! The prices are pretty fair. They have a nice selection of Google everything. I got a sweet deal on my Pixel phone and also love and I do mean love my Google Fi as myself provider! I love the Pixel phone because you don't have to touch it to do anything it does everything for you. I'll probably get lazy but it's a fun lazy😉🌞❣️","The main draw for Google Shopping is that you can just throw things in your cart from different stores and buy them automatically through Google. You don't have to keep creating accounts at every different store and adding your payment and address information constantly over and over. Unfortunately, that's about where the benefit ends. Google chooses a retailer for you automatically. If you select a different one, you have to go to their website, which then defeats the purpose of the app.","Works sometimes. Can't access the list if there's no cell or wifi. Even if the list is on the screen before I enter the store. Interface is a bit clunky, can't exit the app with the < key sometimes. Not being able to access the list offline is becoming a disqualifier."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.shopping.express","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.google.android.apps.shopping.express","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.shopping.express&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.google.android.apps.shopping.express/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.google.android.apps.shopping.express/similar"},{"title":"ShopSavvy - Barcode Scanner & Price Comparison","description":"The best price comparison, barcode scanning and product search app. \r\n\r\nThe original Barcode Scanner and price checker.

I like that they send your rebate balance in a check. I haven't used the gas rebates because there are no participating gas stations near me. There is not a whole lot of rebate offers that are relevant to me, so really I'm not getting a whole lot back... but when I do, I'm happy!","I've been using this app for maybe five six hours and it seems limited and it's ability to save on any money like this limits in it I might not be sure let me just be new to the app my girlfriend told me to get it and download it I think it might be a waste of space I'm hoping it saves me money on gas who knows so that's why I'm going to give it three stars out of five... kind of like seems like there should be an app that has a lot more savings options & faster cash back","Easy app. I really like the idea of not having to \"pre select\" what you will purchase. Shop as normal THEN see if there's anything you can claim.","Nice way to make a little extra cash.

Please fix this app guys. I love guitar center so much. 😔","Decent app, but could use some speed optimization and general improvements. A better user interface would be welcome as well, with a more refined way to shop by category. But the most important and much needed update would be to optimize it and get the app working faster. Occasionally it glitches and freezes when trying to view product photos too. Some improvements in these areas and it would be a great shopping app!","Like MANY USERS have pointed out, latest App update does not work! My experience is that the App opens once after the install or update, and never works again until the App is removed and reinstalled. Then it opens the first time, but never a second time. Come on, can't you app developers get this fixed? Updated App 12/10. Uninstalled, rebooted, reinstalled. Same problems. Updated App 2/27. Uninstalled, rebooted, reinstalled. Same problems. Very frustrated. The App is useless.","I love this app, because it shows me what Guitar Center has in their store, and it also keeps me up to date on the guitars and Banjos like the 6 strings that are very hard to find in other stores a round the country. Plus if I see something that I like, I can always get a hold of someone to talk to about the instrument.","You guys really dont want anyone to browse your merchandise huh? The website is slower than my 92 year old great grandmother and the app doesnt even work at all. It works when you first install it for a minute then it just keeps crashing. I'm sticking to reverb.

I love watching the stylists learn your style and select things for you they think you'd like. The app on the other hand could use some work. The section where you swipe through and decide which outfit or article of clothing is your style is very limited. The clothing is all kinda same same, what you'd find in a department store and it only goes through three cards before it's done and then you have to wait for the next day. Be much better if you got to swipe through more.","The app could be more intuitive. The loading image & time to navigate from one page to another are annoying. Redeeming a promo code is difficult depending on the origin. I used a referral code from a friend & the app didn't take it, so I had to contact customer support. The service itself is ok. I specified typed of items I wanted and, out of 4 boxes, MOST items did not meet my requests. I will try again now both parties have a better idea of how the other works/thinks.","Style shuffle has become super inconsistent. Attempting to get it to show up has become a chore. This is the thing I do the most in the app, so it's furustrating that it rarely shows up on initial load. When it does work, there's usually a point where shuffle looks like it's showing you the same thing 3-5 times in a row. It's not. You have to click the image to try to force it to refresh the image and you'll see that it's a totally different item.","I was really excited to try stitch fix as I have a unique style and sometimes its hard to find clothing. So I filled out the style quiz, added reference photos to what I like and everything. But when I recieved the pictures of what items were being sent I was beyond disappointed. It was evident that the stylist hadn't even considered what I had said, it didn't match me at all. Not worth the 20 dollar styling fee.","Don't even bother. They say the items are starting at $25, and you get to let them know a price point you'd be comfortable with. I selected the lowest cost for everything and every single item I received was over $50. Half of the items in my box were not even remotely my style or were things I had asked specifically not to get (blouses). I also asked for color and fun prints or designs or unique items and literally all 5 items were black & white and so plain. A complete waste of $20."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.stitchfix.stitchfix","url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.stitchfix.stitchfix","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stitchfix.stitchfix&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.stitchfix.stitchfix/permissions","similar":"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/apps/com.stitchfix.stitchfix/similar"}]
